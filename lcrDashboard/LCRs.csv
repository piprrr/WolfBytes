Mr Schade, you are right I do represent district 26 in the Alabama House, which is Southern Marshall and a portion of Dekalb County. I represent this district in Montgomery in the Legislature, not in Washington in Congress. 

Representative Rich,

Thank you for the prompt response. I am working with a group call Wolf-Pac and we are reaching out to Alabama legislators with the hope that Alabama will become the sixth state to call for a limited amendment convention as authorized by Article V of the U.S. Constitution to restore Free and Fair Elections in America. The Article V process is the states check on the excesses of the federal government and judicial branch. Washington has tried and failed repeatedly to address campaign finance reform so I believe it is time for the states to act. I would appreciate a few moments of your time to discuss our proposed resolution and how the states can force Congress to address campaign finance reform in a meaningful way.

Thank you for your consideration,
Robert (Bob) Schade",2 - Not Confirmed,AL

Arthur Orr,Bob Schade,11/6/2017,Met Legislator,"Meeting with Senator Orr at his Decatur office.
40-minute meeting – Senator Orr is an affable and likeable person. He is a proponent of campaign finance reforms and has managed to pass some reform legislation in Alabama. However, he is a proponent of transparency, not contribution limits. He is very familiar with the Article V process has he was involved in getting legislation passed in Alabama calling for an Article V convention for a balanced budget amendment. He is aware of Wolf-Pac, but he seems to conflate Wolf-Pac’s amendment content intentions versus the simple calling for a convention. I kept steering the conversation back to Wolf-Pac’s call for a convention only and that policy would be set by the convention delegates, not Wolf-Pac.

Senator Orr welcomed my intent to call him back in a few weeks. However, he believes his yet to be sent letter will explain his position to me without any further contact needed. I will follow up with him by phone, but I surmise that his Republican roots will keep him from supporting Wolf-Pac’s resolution. ",3 - Unsupportive,AL

Ms. Epstein and I spoke about Free & Fair Elections. She state she is for keeping money out of politics but she has a lot of questions as to our idea of resolution thru Limited and not Constitutional Amendment Convention. 
Her main questions are...
1. Donor/Voter Rule. We can both understand the need to eliminate big business, lobbiest and corporate backers. BUT, she also sees the need to define it because some of the donors from other states are the relatives of the people running. So we need to clarify who can be a donor. Best quote she gave me was that we needed to ""get back to 1 vote/ 1 person, and not 1-$1/ 1 vote"". Also reminded me that Arizona does have a Clean Elections Commision currently and is trying to push it as an example for the rest of the country.

2. Paragraph 7 on our Arizona Resolution statement draft. She doesn't understand how we can do only a limited convention verses the constitutional one. She doesn't see how a limited even works, so we need to get her information about it. She also wants to know if we have spoken to any constitutional lawyers about the vaiidity of only a limited convention. 
She also wanted us to know about the Convention in September that the GOP is holding. It will be a mainly GOP ""party"" that will be paid for by all of the states budget funds, so Arizona is also being billed for a convention that is being widely known as a GOP Party. They are going to be working on two main themes: Term Limits & Budget Reform.

Dave Young,Megan Eleazer/Kenneth Lyon,12/17/2016,Met Legislator,"Had a good meeting with Representative Young. He is a very ""Pragmatic"" guy. He is supportive of the issue but wants to make sure we are making a practical approach to it. Suggested we really target the Republican Caucus in the Senate, but we should be careful not to get a target on us because there is definitely Koch money there (we should focus on moderate Republicans first and hopefully get them to help us sway the more conservative ones). I think he wants to see bipartisan support for our resolution for it to be practical. I do think that he will support our resolution if put to a vote, but I also think he wants to see us organize with Arndt and Moreno to figure out how to approach key people like Grantham and other senate republicans. I do not think that we need to talk to him again for a while. If we get active constituents we can have them voice their support, but I don't think we need lengthy meetings.

Dafna Michaelson Jenet,Alex Broom,1/5/2017,Met Legislator,"Alex Broom and Grant Guy attended.

Wants more time to look over everything and do her research, but was supportive of what she heard and how it matched with her reasonings. Left the meeting feeling positive about her eventual support.

Gave us names for potential legislators to reach out to:
Jeff Bridges (was part of occupy Wall St.)
Dave Williams
Susan Bechman *important info below*
- Was told to do our research beforehand
- She was very concerned about $ (but we are unsure whether she wanted the money or if she wants to see money gone)
- gunning for JVC
- aggressive in pursuing her goals

Said to be on the lookout for or reach out to the group (she could not remember the name) that supported 107 and 108 (I dunno what those are...), but the Republican caucus will follow their lead",2 - Not Confirmed,CO
Jessie Danielson,Alex Broom,1/5/2017,Met Legislator,"Alex Broom, Grant Guy, Xavier (blanking on the last name, but we all know this awesome Wolf)

*I went with phonetic spellings of name... be warned*
David Openheim - Chief of Staff
Kelly Watsons - deputy Chief of Staff

All resolutions are joint resolutions.

Philip Arubias (I forgot why I wrote this down, but I think it was for people to reach out to?)

Jame Lucero - Staffer for the Speaker, he is who we should speak to for setting up a time with the Speaker. Grant has additonal contact info for him, as well as potential people who we should be reaching out to.

Said 20 consitutent phonecalls is unheard of. I got the impression, about 4 phone calls from constituents will make her take notice.

Will not say whether she supports or does not support until she sees the actual resolution. For the official draft, she will give feedback.

Process of a resolution (bill is similar):
- Our proposal
- Draft lawyers look at proposal and make an official draft
- Actual draft is EITHER kept secret OR Floated
-- also the person (Jeni Arndt) who makes the draft, doesn't have to show us
- draft can be modified slighlty with feedback

Susan Beckman,Michael Icenogle,1/30/2017,Emailed legislator,"My email to my Rep:
Greetings, Representative Susan Beckman!

This is Michael Icenogle, who met with you the other day about campaign finance reform (via the non-partisan group 'Wolf-PAC'). 
First off, as my initial visit to our state's capitol, it was absolutely invigorating speaking with you! In no small terms, our meeting re-instilled in me faith in our representative Republic. This may be a bit hyperbolic or naïve, but as a Millennial, I have been so down-trodden that I doubted this even possible.

I do believe in this cause, and I do believe the States must bring about this change for our great nation via an Article V Limited Convention (the Federals cannot or will not - little to no difference). I am sure you've reviewed the materials our group provided, and have found whatever info you were looking for.

A 'Yes' vote on this matter is wonderful, but if you find our purpose a worthy one, a Republican Sponsorship in CO's House would be fantastic. For what it's worth, I sincerely believe this legislation won't be a liability in the minds of Coloradans; rather, it will be in-line with our deepest held values (as mixed and varied as we are). 

I look forward to returning to our Capitol, and hopefully seeing & talking with you again!

Good luck & Godspeed!

Cole Wist,Mary Daugherty,1/31/2017,Emailed legislator,"Sent email following up on phone message left one week prior. No response. : ( Here's the email sent 1/31/17: Good Morning Representative Wist:

I left word in your office a week ago asking for your support of the Free and Fair Resolution, and asking how you feel about it. The purpose of the Free & Fair Elections Resolution is to restore balance and integrity to our elections with a U.S. Constitutional Amendment so that the voices of average citizens aren’t drowned out by special interests (from both the left and right) and our elections work better for all Americans. From what I understand this would work well for legislators also since so much time is spent in fundraising efforts.

As your constituent, I urge your support on this important legislation. 

Below are links to the Free and Fair Elections resolution and flyer. Please let me know if I can count on your support, or if we can set up a time to discuss this important issue.

He asked if we had a draft on bill paper yet. Jonathan had thought someone told him we'd get a draft about a month earlier. So we told him that it definitely didn't happen a month ago. He said he could submit the wording to the Office of Legislative Legal Services (OLLS) to get an official draft. So he did this while we were in his office with him. He thought it would help the process if people could see this draft. He said we could check back with him on Tuesday to see if he had anything back from the OLLS. He also mentioned that the OLLS and him would have attorney-client privilege over this, so nobody else would see it unless the OLLS is given permission. 

He mentioned that Larry Crowder might be another good Republican to check with, although he's hard to get a hold of. He mentioned to be prepared for runaway convention fears, although he didn't personally have any questions about that. ",1 - Supportive,CO

He agreed that money in politics is a problem, and that a 28th amendment is the best way to solve it. We spent a while walking through the amendment convention process. He asked about how we know the process wouldn't go off process. We walked him through the basic 5 points: 
1) The convention won't be called unless all 34 resolutions are on the same topic. 
2) Once the convention is called, the states have the power to rescind the delegates if they go off-topic. 
3) The supreme court can rule that the convention has gone off-topic.
4) The convention can only propose an amendment. 
5) 3/4 of states would have to approve the amendment. 
We also mentioned that we also have reports from the DOJ, ABA and CRS if he would like them. We pointed out the DOJ summary in the packet we gave him, and he said he was happy with that and didn't need the full reports. 

We talked about the 5 states that have passed, the 14 states that it's filed in this year. We pointed out that we have bipartisan support. 

He seemed supportive, but wasn't willing to give us a yes yet. He said he doesn't put his name on anything without running it by leadership, because he's still new and learning. Although he said he's definitely interested. 

He asked if we've met with the Speaker and the President yet. We told him we haven't met with the speaker yet this session, and that Grant has been meeting with Jeni multiple times during this session. He said he would talk to Dominic Moreno, and that he usually respects Dominic's opinion on this sort of thing. 

He asked why we didn't meet with the speaker first. We explained that we've met with almost everyone and only have 5-10 people we haven't met with yet in the House and Senate.

Are you going to be up at the Capitol Friday speaking to other legislators? I don't have plans after adjournment, and could speak with you briefly. However, being Budget Week, I can't predict any times. If we don't finish tonight, we may actually be on the Floor all day tomorrow. 

If it's easier for you, we could meet somewhere in Lone Tree - perhaps have a cup of coffee? 

I haven't seen the resolution, but would like to read it before we meet. If it's been introduced, you may have a number, or the name of the sponsor, which would allow me to look it up.""

Thanks so much for returning my email as I know you are very busy with it being Budget Week. My apologies for not responding sooner as I didn't see it until this morning.

I said yes and he said he already knew all about it and that he was completely against it. I asked him if he thought money was a problem in politics. He said yes but this was not the way to fix it. I asked if we could meet in person to discuss it and he said he would meet with me but not Wolfpac people. I asked if someone from Wolfpac could come if they just listened. He went as far as to say if someone showed up other than me that he would leave. I met with him. He shared his life work history and that he had run for another position and lost. I had read this about him before our meeting and commented that he only lost by about 2,000 votes. He commented on how much more money his opponent had raised and spent. I commented that had the money have been more equal, he might have won. He said he was against the Mccain Feingold bill. He said he did not believe that there was anything wrong with the constitution and that it should not be changed. He commented that any amount of money should be able to be directly given to a candidate because any restrictions would be limiting free speech. He is a strongly religious man who also said that George Soros was the money behind Wolfpac. I said I did not believe he was and would get that information. I also brought up that I had previously been told George Soros had funded something else and that had not been true before. I discussed the George Soros involvement was commonly being said whether he was involved or not in political issues. The meeting was very long. I had to leave to pick up my daughter. I did not anticipate it would be over two hours. After the conversation I just had with Grant, I will be calling to try to convince him to have another meeting that would include Grant by getting him to see that there is no George Soros connection and that Grant is just simply another concerned Coloradan.

We did talk about money in politics and he brought up Citizens United. Fortunately, training taught me to steer clear of Citizens United so I mostly listened. I didn't get a chance to get a word in edgewise or mention I was with Wolf-Pac. I was able to put across some ideas about how important disclosure of funds is to illuminating where a legislator stands on an issue & on how this could help prevent a monetary ""arms race."" He seemed to like the idea that politics should be a war of ideas not $. Other than that though, 

I don't think I changed his mind. I'll consider it a win if he thinks our proposition isn't inherently evil. I'd love to have an extreme right-wing person like Neville champion our cause, but I can always dream. He's a friendly person, whether it's genuine or purely his political nature, I don't know.

John Cooke,Megan Eleazer,12/14/2016,Met Legislator,"Good Meeting with Senator (Sheriff) John Cooke. He was down to earth and very pleasant. Didn't commit to supporting our resolution, but was over all supportive of the concept and is NOT worried about the Article V conspiracies. Biggest concerns: 
- Anti-popular vote, wants to make sure that our goal isn't going to try to get rid of the Electoral College.
- The State Republican Caucus seems to be backing Kevin Lundberg's resolution to call a convention for a Balanced Budget.He seemed hesitant that he could support both calls for a convention. Maybe that they would have to go hand in hand if both pass. We confirmed that they were separate calls for a convention and he could support both, and the first issue that gets to 34 states wins (gets to call the convention on their topic) haha. 
- Is worried about our ability to convince other legislators that Article V is a viable path. 
- Wants to make sure that the amendment doesn't just target (perceived) ""evil"" corporations (wants to make sure unions don't get to take control). I think he wants to make sure there is a level playing field. 

He will be following up with Jenni Arndt and Dominick Moreno for more details on our resolution. 

Tried to keep the conversation neutral. Talked about how we want to fix things so we can get back to the discussion of ideas in politics, which we don't have currently. 

We should wait till after the session starts to meet with him again. He knows we will be at the Capitol on January 11th. ",2 - Not Confirmed,CO

He definitely agrees that money is a big issue. He is very hesitant about Article V, but seems that once he feels reassured about the fact that it won't run away, he will be on board. Once we get him on board, I think he will be a big ally in the Senate. He may be a Dem, but he is a very careful guy, and I think the Republicans in the senate may listen to him.

Isn't huge fan of Article V, but since the Balanced Budget Amendment is using the same approach, he isn't against it. I think he also likes the idea of states deciding their own campaign finance. He also wants to make sure if there is any limiting of funds that unions are included and not just corporations. Alison made a good point that the Leftists have made a bad name for campaign finance reform with catch phrases like, ""Corporations aren't people"" and ""Money isn't speech"", but with Citizen's United it not only made corporations people but Unions too. Over all if we can start to sway other Republicans and particularly Leadership I think he will be supportive. ",2 - Not Confirmed,CO

However, did encourage us to have the Resolution drafted on Resolution Paper (which Alison thought was a good idea), encouraged us to make a bullet point summary of what we are looking to achieve because legislators are usually too busy to read things, possibly get a Republican co-prime sponsor to sign on with Jenni or Dominick to make the resolution look stronger, and once drafted, start a physical list of co-sponsors and supporters to give to legislators (don't know if we will do that one). I found the suggestions helpful, and I think he will support us when the time comes even with hesitations of Article V.

If you have potential ideas for legislation, please feel free to send them to our office via email at senleroygarcia@gmial.com. Once again, thank you for taking the time to reach out and I will be sure to pass along your kind words and any possible ideas you may have.

Owen Hill,Jake Altinger,8/28/2017,Emailed legislator,"-Emailed asking to meet and discuss the resolution.

-Senator Hill responded within a few minutes:
""Thanks Jacob. I am always up for a good conversation but This resolution doesn't say how to ensure free and fair elections. Do you have any more specifics for what you are proposing?""

-My response:
""That’s correct, Senator. This resolution is simply to call for a convention to amend the Constitution, pursuant to Article V of the Constitution. The exact details of that amendment would have to be worked out by the delegates of that convention. 

""Potential policies to limit the influence of special interests in our elections focus primarily on campaign finance reform. Proposals range from instituting public financing of all elections, to limiting the amount of money special interest groups, PACs, and Super-PACs may donate to federal campaigns. Another policy proposal is to only allow campaign donations to federal candidates from persons, corporations, unions, or other interest groups who reside in that candidate’s district. All of these policy proposals, and more, will have to be debated and reconciled through compromise by the delegates of the Article V convention. The resolution itself does not advocate for any one specific policy. It simply acknowledges the need for campaign finance reform to check the influence of powerful special interest groups over our federal elections. 

""Article V of the Constitution allows for two ways to amend the Constitution. The first is for two-thirds of Congress to draft the amendment, and then have it ratified by three-fourths of the states. The second method is for two-thirds of state legislatures to call for a convention to draft an Amendment, which must also then be ratified by three-fourths of the states.

""Because of the corrupting influence of special interests at the federal level, I trust you, my state senator, far more than any of my federal representatives to address this extremely important issue and do right by the people of Colorado.

""I would be happy to meet with you and discuss any further questions you may have about the resolution or the Article V Amendment process. Please let me know if you might have time to it me into your schedule. I would greatly appreciate it.""

Unfortunately, the Representative was very effective at changing the topic and giving excuses for why he would be opposed to our resolution.

He repeatedly made the point that money in politics is a just a symptom of the greater problem - the big, evil Federal government - if you reduce the size of the government you wouldn't have the special interests and the corruption (obviously a ridiculous claim). He also questioned the methodology of polls that overwhelmingly show people's concern with money's influence in politics, and said that an Article V Convention would never get passed as evidenced by the difficulty in getting a balanced budget Article V Convention. When I made the point about the 17th Amendment getting pushed into law by calls for a Article V Convention, Rep. France claimed that this was a bad development for American Democracy as the Senators were no longer representative of their states and their legislatures. This guy will be nearly impossible to convince, but I will keep trying to have the conversation, and keep better focused on our critical points.",3 - Unsupportive,CT

He talked about minimum wage and 'prevailing wage', which I had not heard about before. He doesn't have strong feelings about the effects of money in politics, but he isn't against this resolution. He, like Rep. Collins is interested in knowing exactly who the winners and losers are if this happens. I told him in my opinion, the winners will be states and citizens, and he didn't seem to disagree. In any case, he is going to discuss the model resolution with his legislative assistant (Joe Folger (haven't confirmed last name spelling)). I would say he is somewhat supportive, and absolutely open to the idea but isn't going to blindly give his support. I emphasized how important this is to me for the future, and how I believe this might be our last best chance to get back our democracy. I will send a followup email later today. He is very concerned about the education budget in DE, which is very high. If we can find a good talking point on that, I think it could be very effective with the house minority caucus. I think his assistant Joe is very knowledgeable and will likely to be the one who brings up the most concerns to me, so I'm go to have to try and develop a relationship with him, fortunately I have talked briefly to him and introduced myself to him. 

Overall I'm not going to say he's supportive yet, but I'd say he can absolutely be swayed to support. And he said if he's satisfied with the details, he is willing to introduce but that's not the discussion for now. ",2 - Not Confirmed,DE

He accepted these points readily enough, and I followed up on them in an email. He brought up the issue of balancing the federal budget, so it would seem he's not against an Article V Convention, assuming he was talking about the BBA given the context.

Harvey Kenton,Wayne Biggs,11/16/2017,Phone call with Legislator,"I spoke with Harvey Kenton in the evening, he told me he had just got home around 9PM. Interesting to note he is good friends with Dave Wilson, who I have met and talked to about Delaware Get Money out.

He said very quickly that he doesn't believe that money in politics is a problem in Delaware, and he doesn't care to get involved in federal issues. But he understands my concerns, even if he doesn't share them. That's nice of him to say, but doesn't seem to indicate that he'd be interested in working on this issue. 

He's familiar with this idea of Article V, and says that he gets at least 15 e-mail about it a day. (Maybe hyperbole, he's a bit boisterous.) I talked about how large donors priorities are much more highly favoured (at least on the federal level.), and he was receptive to that idea. I offered to send him more information, and he said he prefers hard copies of things, and asked that I send him any information by mail, so I'll be putting together some documents to send him. 

On a unrelated note, his rhetoric was highly partisan. I try to keep communications absolutely neutral, but Rep. Kenton brought up his disdain for northern DE politicians quickly and several times. I probably accidentally gave him the impression that I'm conservative, (not the case) and he talked for a bit about the Trans issue Delaware is currently in a tizzy about. I of course didn't give a positive or negative response, but it was personally difficult to listen to, He mentioned how Republicans can't get much done because of Dem control over the chambers, and I stressed how I feel the harmful effects of money in politics are non-partisan.

I told her to expect a contact from Elise Mysels. Elise then made an appointment for Feb 27th. We both attended.

Rep Mariano was late to the meeting, so Elise and discussed most of our concerns with the legislative aide, Lisa Kauffman. Lisa was very understanding of the problems with our election system.

Rep Mariano came late. She was also understanding of the need for election reform, but when I asked what she thought of our proposal, I feel that she was afraid of it. She wanted to do something at a lower level of government. Elise had something prepared for this scenario. I do not think that she is a lost cause. I think that she would support this if introduced by someone else. I also think she can be pushed into introducing if more people push her to do so.

Jackie Toledo,Dan Hoffman,8/21/2017,Met Legislator,"This was a positive meeting. She said she would take this to her class (I assume class meetings are by party, but perhaps it is Democrats and Republicans) to get their take. I don't expect her to be willing to sponsor it -
but I think she would be swayable to support it with more people on board. She recommended that we think of something smaller - sort of a ""baby step"" to this - which is something I welcome thoughts on. Obviously that is problematic given our end goal, but not a show stopper. Some of the things I learned from talking to her. 1) HB 1057 is a Campaign Financing Bill that was introduced by Representative Gruter (H-73) - who is in Jacksonville. The bill has to do with campaign finance reform and ""dark money."" We should really try and get someone to talk to him - if we can't get someone local to talk to him we should try and get someone to get him on the phone - he seems like a very real possibility. 2) A representative is most likely to do this in either their first term (when they don't have a lot of power anyway), or in their last term when they have nothing to lose. Something to consider going forward. 3) There were two co-sponsors to HB 1057 - Rep Fischer (H-16) who is in Duvall County, and Rep Killebrew (H-41) in Polk. Again, we should try and get people to sit down with these folks - these are first term guys who are a real possibility. 4) Rep Toledo was supportive because she faced outside money in her primary . . . there are probably a lot of Republicans in a similar situation. I was surprised by how positive she seemed about the memorial, but given her experience, it isn't that surprising - and there are a lot of Republicans having that experience, which means there are lots of possibilities out there if we do our homework.

Jesse Petrea,Heidi Behnke,12/7/2016,Phone call with Legislator,"After two days of phone tag, I made first contact with Representative Jesse Petrea. I started by giving him a long story about how I came to be mistrustful of money's influence in politics. He tried to jump the gun on the conversation, and I'd recommend future discussions be brief. Petrea isn't very sympathetic to our cause, but I don't think his mind is made up. He did say that this was his first run for office and that he raised $100,000.00. He was very impressed with how much he raised, and believes that this is directly tied to support of his beliefs. I pointed out that the average incomes for the state (est. $26k for individuals) is so low that many people cannot afford to give even if they support platforms. He acknowledged that this system did alter the playing field. He wanted to see the proposed resolution and, once I send it to him, will arrange a time to meet with me in person before the legislative session starts.

Side note: he is very familiar with (and supportive of) the constitutional convention model. He brought up that Georgia passed similar legislation in the past on the issue of passing balanced budgets. He reminded me that these efforts are long-shots, and I pointed out that this is why I've thrown time into working with Wolf-PAC: it's a nationwide movement, and a number of states are already on board.

Side-side note: Petrea's top issue is revising the parole system for violent criminals. He wants to keep them in jail rather than on the streets, where a not-insignificant number re-offend while on parole. I don't think this can be tied to our issue, but might be a good note for future conversations.

Petrea is not going to be a sponsor (my opinion), but might be motivated to vote for us. He did say that he was a straight-forward guy, and that he will let me know a yes or no.",3 - Unsupportive,GA

Martin Carbaugh,Jamie Drake,5/15/2017,Met Legislator,"I label Mr. Carbaugh as unconfirmed, however he is sympathetic to the concerns. He has benefitted from Super Pac advertising in the past, and he did not appreciate that the messaging from his own campaign was being affected by people outside of his campaign. He also understands that newcomers have a big hill to climb if they wish to run for federal office. He listened well to my information (which I provided to him via printed articles) about public opinion polls and the recent study by Gilens and Page in which the authors correlate the votes of federal officials not to the will of the people but to the will of economic elites and special interest groups. I also pointed out that there is a negative correlation between what voters want and what the economic elite and special interest groups want. Mr. Carbaugh listened well. He does have two concerns:
(1) dark money (Super PAC) might become worse if an amendment were passed. He stated that as it is at least we have some transparency in the contributions list. I responded that since he was quick to notice that potential problem, then other people would also notice that pottentiality and it could be addressed in an Article V limited convention.
(2) a ""runaway"" convention -- Mr. Carbaugh related that state senator David Long was leeading a national push for a balanced budget amendment to the constitution but that Long's efforts were derailed by sympathetic people who feared a runaway convention. I relayed to him the summary of the Justice Department study on the Article V convention and that Congress would have the authority to confine the convention according to the wishes of the petitions of the states, and that after that the courts, Congress, the states, and the delegates would be able to guarantee the limited nature of the Article V convention. 

We had a very cordial conversation, I provided Mr. Carbaugh with printed articles, and we agreed to meet again at some point later in the year. ",2 - Not Confirmed,IN
Matt Pierce,William Vanden Dries,5/17/2017,Met Legislator,"Pierce recognizes the issue is a serious problem. He sees the biggest hurdle as getting enough Republican support in the statehouse. He said that the Speaker of the House actually has the power to send the resolution to whichever committee he wants, and that if it goes to the rules committee it means he wants it to die there. He still has some concerns about the ""runaway"" convention, but says he still needs to read more from both sides of the debate. He brought up Common Cause by name and shared their website ""The Dangerous Path"" with me. I shared several of the talking points from the DOJ memo and gave him a copy of the DOJ report as well as a copy of the resolution. He also brought up the precedent in Indiana from SJ14 about making it criminal for delegates to go off topic at the convention, which I saw as a good thing. He said the Indiana Democrats are likely to make money corrupting elections and legislators a primary issue moving forward after seeing it happen a lot at the state house. He said at one point in the conversation that if it were to make it to the floor of the House, he would vote for it. ",1 - Supportive,IN

Justin Moed,Ibrahim Al-Hamed,2/7/2017,Met Legislator,"Representative Justin Moed sent a mailer that listed some office hours at various public locations in February and March. I attended the first of these, which took place at a Steak n Shake. I arrived rather late, but was able to ask him about what we can do to help just before he had to leave.

He mentioned that the proposal for our resolution still needs a hearing, and gave me a list of names to contact, which included Speaker Brian Bosma, the Chair of Elections Milo Smith, and my State Senator Jack Sandlin. When asked what I should tell these people upon contacting them, Moed said that I should just ask them to help the proposal get a hearing. I held off on contacting these people because I felt the timing wasn't right, and signed on to volunteer with Wolf-PAC soon after.

He seemed pleasantly surprised by my question, considering that most other attendees were there to talk about the bills that were being discussed in the 2017 Legislative Session at the time. I got the sense that he really wanted the resolution to be discussed, but was facing obstacles in getting that discussion started in the House.",1 - Supportive,IN

Justin Moed,Ibrahim Al-Hamed,6/27/2017,Met Legislator,"Jason Boudi and I had the pleasure of meeting with Representative Justin Moed this afternoon. We spent about 45 minutes talking about the process of passing a resolution in Indiana and how we can help our legislators after they've expressed support for the Wolf-PAC resolution. Representative Moed gave us a number of likely supporters that we should try to contact and let us know of important dates and deadlines. One important event that was mentioned in the conversation was Organization Day, which sounds like it would be a great opportunity for a Day of Action. We were also given some strategic advice on how to pitch the Wolf-PAC resolution to other legislator.

From the very beginning, Representative Moed couldn't make his support for the resolution more clear. You could tell he had faith that this is going to work, as he mentioned multiple times that he knows that other legislators are also sick of the negative influence that the current corruption has on their jobs. He would like us to check in with him about once a month and let him know where things are going. He is willing to sponsor our resolution, but would like to hold off on finalizing that decision until he sees how things develop from this point on. As a matter of strategy, our chances would be better if we could get a Republican legislator to sponsor the resolution instead. ",1 - Supportive,IN

He was surprised that Dennis Kruse seemed to be supportive (having sent the resolution to the Legislative Services Agency to be prepped). He was adamant that Kruse was a great voice to have on this because of his standing in the Education Committee and his experience and status. But minimized his own voice due to his newcomer status. He suggested we find a different House member to bring this up, due to fears of it being suppressed by the Speaker of the house or the Leader of the Senate. He felt that the best course of action would be to have the senate bring it to committee and then vote, then have the house vote. He gave us some names that he thought would be a more powerful voice in this discussion: Matt Lehman, Brian Bosma, Ben Smaltz. 

""You need to talk to the guys here in this area - Northeast Indiana.""

Hi, 
So sorry that it took me so long to get back with you, family emergencies...
Anyway, I would like to sit down and discuss in order of importance:
1. The resolution Sen. Kruse voted for last year (a couple years ago?): why he voted for it, what his goal is for it. 
2. What measures he would like to see us take so we are a more equally representative government. How we could achieve free and fair elections. (Maybe: How we can better educate our electorate and raise the percentage of voting public to the standards other countries enjoy.)
3. Environmental protections...
4. The minimum wage...
5. Childcare...
6. Encouraging entrepreneurial spirit among people.
I understand we will be short on time so if we don't have enough to do everything on that list, the most important ones would be number one and number two followed by 3. If we can get those two or three things covered in an in-depth way, I would feel very happy about our meeting. Thank you for your time and for Senator Kruse's time to hear me out.

Sandlin then argued that the problem, in his view, was lack of participation on the citizens' part.

He also mentioned that I could look at his donors and his legislation, expressing doubt that I'd find any evidence of him being influenced by money. He went on to say that he thinks his colleagues are also able to make the right decision without being influenced by their donors. I asked if he thought that held true for legislators at the federal level, stating my belief that all human beings are psychologically vulnerable to these influences. He claimed that even at the federal level, he doesn't believe that legislators listen to their donors over their voters.

I asked the Senator what he thought of conducting a survey of his constituents to see what they thought. He started talking about how statistics are often used by people in a biased way to push the agendas of those who use them.

After handing him a copy of the Resolution template, he took issue with the third paragraph, saying that the Supreme Court decision in Citizens United was a decision that was made by people who take extreme care in judging the law. He then explained the Supreme Court decision and how it allowed for unlimited contributions. I mentioned how that seems unfair because it drowns out the voices of average citizens. He didn't think that was the case. 

After stating that the Resolution is meant to start a conversation and that the exact form of the solution that would be proposed by the convention couldn't be determined ahead of time, Sandlin stated that the Resolution needed a more well-defined solution and said that he can't see how the states would ever pass a Resolution that seemed so risky. He insisted on this, even after I mentioned that the states can limit the topic and give instructions, but must leave the matter of writing the concrete language to the delegates at the convention. 

His bottom line was that there's a need to figure out how to reengage people and get them involved in government. He didn't see that there was an issue of legislators being influenced by donors and special interests. He asked me to email him more information about Wolf-PAC and its agenda. 

Overall, his words communicated that he'd keep an open mind about it, but his body language gave me the sense that his stance on the Wolf-PAC resolution is a hard ""no,"" even though he never said it directly. I kept open the prospect of continuing the discussion at a later time after we've had time to think about the ideas that were brought up. I plan on trying a few more times, but my current expectation is that his stance won't change. ",3 - Unsupportive,IN

Chris told me that he'd be seeing Senator Ruckelshaus later in the morning and get back to me about when the Senator would be available to take a call.",N/A,IN
John Ruckelshaus,Ibrahim Al-Hamed,7/24/2017,Phone call with Legislator,"I had the pleasure of receiving a phone call from Senator Ruckelshaus and used the opportunity to make my case. I began by talking about how I developed an interest in politics. I then went into how people don't have a lot of trust in the federal government, citing the figure published a few months ago by The Economist that shows only 9% of Americans saying they trust the federal government. 

I mentioned how 93% of Americans want universal background checks on gun purchases, including 80% of NRA members, yet Congress still hasn't passed any legislation, when common sense would suggest that passing gun safety legislation should be a ""slam dunk"". I mentioned that there were other similar policies I couldn't remember off the top of my head that were greatly popular among the public, but get ignored by Congress. I then stated my belief that the reason for this inaction by Congress has to do with the influence of donors on politicians.

Senator Ruckelshaus agreed with me that a lot of people don't trust government. He described Citizens United as creating ""a mess"" in our government. I couldn't tell for sure if he disagreed with the Citizens United decision in principle, or if he just disagreed with how it has been put into practice, so I made sure to state that groups against corruption in government had differing opinions on whether Citizens United was the root cause of the problems we're seeing. We talked about the phenomenon of people saying they like their Congressman while thinking that most of Congress is corrupt, and I agreed that I observed the same thing in people. 

It was around this point that Senator Ruckelshaus stated that the problem I'm talking about involves the federal government, and that he worked at the state level. I used this opportunity to talk about our solution of calling for a Convention of the States to start a national conversation about the corrupting influence of money in politics. I mentioned that other groups would like to address the problem through other means, such as ballot initiatives and making efforts to elect better candidates for Congress, but that the Amendment option was the one that I thought made the most sense.

The Senator had some questions about how all of this works, and expressed concerns about a ""runaway convention"". I told him that our group has looked into that and that I'm in the middle of reading a report from the Department of Justice that makes the argument that such fears are not well-founded, and offered to send him the report via e-mail, to which he agreed. We then talked about SJR 14, an Amendment resolution that the Indiana legislature passed last year (prior to Senator Ruckelshaus being elected). He vaguely described that he'd heard of it and I recognized it and told him what I remembered of it. He asked how many resolutions have been passed by the state and I explained that there were actually hundreds of resolutions, but that there haven't been 34 resolutions on a similar topic, and that, in order to require a convention, 34 resolutions would need to be gathered in the same ""pile"" first. Congress would then be required to call a convention, delegates would be sent by the states, the delegates would propose an Amendment, and three quarters of the states would have to ratify the Amendment before it could become law. I mentioned the 5 states that we have already.

Senator Ruckelshaus said he'd talk about this with the President of the Senate, David Long. He said that Senator Long would be an expert on the topic of Amendment resolutions, and said that he'd want to discuss it with Long over e-mails back and forth to get a better idea of how it works, what the resolutions chances would be, and if it would be worth pursuing. I told him that I'd send him a big e-mail with lots of additional information while he tried to discuss the idea with Senator Long, and he seemed to be looking forward to that information. 

Overall, Senator Ruckelshaus seems to be very open-minded about the idea, but needs more information. He's more ""on the fence"", but I can tell that he's likely going to be a supporter of our resolution once he has had more time to think about it and received more information about the Amendment process.",2 - Not Confirmed,IN

Zachary Eckert,

Thank you for calling me to confirm that you got my email regarding a meeting with Sen. Kruse last week. I'm emailing today to find out if he had gotten the message and if he has time for a meeting with me. The future of our representative democracy is under threat and we should address it with no time to lose.

Hi, 
So sorry that it took me so long to get back with you, family emergencies...
Anyway, I would like to sit down and discuss in order of importance:
1. The resolution Sen. Kruse voted for last year (a couple years ago?): why he voted for it, what his goal is for it. 
2. What measures he would like to see us take so we are a more equally representative government. How we could achieve free and fair elections. (Maybe: How we can better educate our electorate and raise the percentage of voting public to the standards other countries enjoy.)
3. Environmental protections...
4. The minimum wage...
5. Childcare...
6. Encouraging entrepreneurial spirit among people.
I understand we will be short on time so if we don't have enough to do everything on that list, the most important ones would be number one and number two followed by 3. If we can get those two or three things covered in an in-depth way, I would feel very happy about our meeting. Thank you for your time and for Senator Kruse's time to hear me out.

Mike Bohacek,Ibrahim Al-Hamed,10/26/2017,Met Legislator,"Payton and I met with Senator Bohacek for about 15 minutes. He said that he had looked at the Wolf-PAC web page and that he couldn't imagine anybody in office that doesn't wish they didn't have to do any fundraising. I handed him a copy of the resolution, and we had a back and forth that was essentially a ""mini-convention"" in his office. He asked how we wanted the problem fixed and we emphasized that the whole point is to get people together to figure out the answer to that question. We gave examples of ideas that we've heard of, such as public financing or the voter-donor rule. 

Sen. Bohacek was able to point out all sorts of problems that might arise from those ideas, countermeasures that could be considered, and problems with those countermeasures. I hadn't thought to say it at the time, but he thinks like a delegate! We called attention to how easily he was coming up with these questions, and how those are exactly the kinds of questions that need to be asked and discussed at an Article V Convention if one were to take place. 

When he mentioned that applications like these get submitted all the time from local governments to state governments and from the states to Congress without ever getting addressed, we mentioned that Congress would be obligated to hold a Convention if 34 states applied for the same topic. We directed his attention to the daisy chain at the end of the resolution, leading to his expression of surprise at the fact that Illinois passed this resolution.

He ultimately ended up saying that he won't make any promises, but he will show the resolution to ""the committee chair"" (not sure which committee he was referring to) and talk about it with his colleagues. He came across as supportive in principle, but not too sure about whether the plan itself would work out. I'd say it's a soft yes, but for now we'll consider his level of support unconfirmed.",2 - Not Confirmed,IN

Expressed more interest in smaller actions to ""chip away"" at money's ability to influence the election. Called himself the Bernie Sanders of this house election due to the fact he raised so much of his money from public small donations. I feel that he was using that as an excuse to say that he would love to support but his election was very close so he does not want to alienate himself this early in his term.

Greg Heartsill,Brendan Hodis,01/28/17,Phone call with Legislator,"Representative Heartsill and I had a very pleasant conversation. He is a small business owner who raises most of his campaign money himself and is fortunate that he does not need to purchase TV adds in his district, but he does not want to limit the ability of like-minded individuals to organize and to donate together. He thinks the best solution is an informed and engaged electorate. 

He thinks that the system can be improved but does not have a ""silver bullet."" He is frustrated by the influence of money leveraged against representatives by party infrastructures (i.e. ""the establishment). He agrees that average individuals cannot reach federal representatives like wealthy individuals and interest groups can and thinks this is wrong. He thinks that the federal government uses money to control states and thinks this is overreach. He agrees that a significant amount of government waste and spending can be explained by the influence of wealthy and powerful individuals and groups.

"70. Foil, Franklin J.",Magdalena Budziakowska,1/30/2017,,Phone call with staff,"I spoke with his secretary who screens all of the calls and emails. He apparently has 7 bills and ideas that he will be bringing to the house and the maximum is 5. His ideas still haven't been publicly posted on the internet. She did acknowledge that she has gotten about 20 phone calls about this very topic and about 10 emails and even referenced Brian Jarreau (my fiance) as calling. I told her that they must be getting an even greater amount of phone calls for the issues that he is going to be bringing to the floor. She said that she has gotten about 200 emails and phone-calls about the other unnamed issues. She guaranteed that my concerns are on his desk to be reviewed. I asked her to give me a guarantee and she said that because I live in Baton Rouge I am on top of the list. She said that people that don't live in Baton rouge have been calling and she has been putting them lower on the list in terms of response times. She listed Brian Jarreau (for example- not knowing that he is my fiance) and told me that he is a New Orleans Photographer and implied that since he lived in New Orleans he wouldn't be getting priority. I told her he is my fiance and that we live in the same place and they should check voting addresses, etc. 
Basically, when we write these emails or discuss I think we need to make it very obvious that we live in a certain district. Instead of just saying ""i'm a citizen of ____"" We need to provide addresses and record that we are in his district otherwise they will just think that we live in New Orleans and are trying to sway opinion. 
The lady was very nice and said that she is excited that people are calling and starting to wake up. I told her this isn't the last time she would be hearing from me and that she will leave my name with our representative and see if he can call me back. ",LA

"5. Seabaugh, Alan",Ian Walters,3/2/2017,,Phone call with Legislator,"Rep. Seabaugh has the following concerns: 1. He believes that if we deny corporate money into political elections then ONLY the independently wealthy will become elected. Therefore, he sees corporate influence as democratizing, as opposed to corrupting. I brought up the fundraising success of Bernie Sanders, to no avail. 2. I insisted upon calling on a DISCUSSION about how to make elections free and fair, so that our representatives represent their constituents, bringing up the conservative idea of only accepting corporate money from local business as well as the progressive idea of publicly funded elections as possibilities to be discussed. However, he believes that unless a specific amendment is pre-drafted, the Article Five convention is not conducive to so ""broad"" a topic as restoring fair elections. Given the lack of specificity, he gave me a clear, ""no"".

However, he also noted that he had tried Article Five in the past, and he repeated that it has never been done before. I personally suspect that as Wolf-Pac becomes more clearly successful, Rep. Seabaugh may be more open-minded about at least the possibility of fielding an open discussion.",LA

I am a big fan of the proverb “what gets measured gets managed” and as you know there are lots of important items detailed in HB 517 that need the communities attention drawn to it. Secondly, there is an urgent matter that I need your help addressing. The American people no longer believe that their government works for them and, according to polls, as high as 96% believe that it is due to the corrupting influence of money in the electoral process. We must restore balance and integrity to our elections. As a citizen of Louisiana, I urge you to support the ""Free and Fair Elections"" resolution, which calls for a U.S. Constitutional Amendment, through a limited convention under Article V that would deal specifically and solely with the issue of ending political corruption. Under such a convention, no other topics can be raised or proposed, and our amendment would have to be ratified by three quarters of the states. There are currently five states that have passed similar resolutions, Vermont, California, Illinois, New Jersey, and Rhode Island, and I would be very proud if you would join me in helping to make Louisiana next. Would you be willing to support this resolution in 2018? I will be following up with a phone call to discuss it with you further. ",LA

I am going to try to follow up with her in person if she is open to it, as she did talk about how she disliked negative ads, and outside money in elections, but also was a little on the defensive as she thought I was saying her election was not free or fair and then we went off topic to what local elections I should keep an eye on. I tried to bring it back to this being a state resolution to call for the national government to take action, and she let me know that isn’t what she likes to focus on… I think if I can prep her and sit with her for an hour, I can convince her to a yes possibly or at least to not vote no on when it comes to committee",LA

Dear Delegate McCray,

Hi, my name is Peter Mariani and I live in your district and I'm writing about the Democracy Amendment Resolution, which is something that I really care about. I think that it’s going to be impossible to make progress on national issues important to Baltimore (like criminal justice reform, gun control, drug policy and student debt) without this resolution. I think is an opportunity for you and the rest of the Maryland legislature to help lead the country into a better place! As your constituent, I would like to thank you for supporting this resolution!

I’m just becoming active in local politics, and I was proud to learn that my delegate is a leader on this issue. So again… Thank you! I also admire your primary challenge to Senator McFadden, I think that a primary challenge will always make the representation of the 45th distract stronger!

I am not certain if he was being serious or not because after explaining he made a joke that he ""thought it was an alma mater from high school"".. After explaining that it is Wolf Pac's goal to get a 28th Amendment passed in the US Constitution because of the destruction Citizens United has caused since the Supreme Court Ruling, he definitely seemed to agree that Citizens United has been a negative influence in America. I do not know whether he agrees that Citizens United has been a destructive force in American politics. He explained he cannot see us for the next two weeks due to the holiday and budget meetings however a staff member would call to set something u[ for three weeks from now. I am expecting that call this week. He told me that he wants to hear our thoughts on the subject. I estimate he agrees with the need to eliminate Citizens United but may be unsure of the bill.

Stanley Rosenberg,Matt Mazzola,5/24/2017,Met with staff,"Meeting started promptly at 9:30. Mr. Sullivan indicated that he totally agrees with the need for reducing the undue influence of corporations and billionaires on our government, so we did not need to spend time presenting arguments to him about the need for a constitutional amendment. However, in the current political climate where the right may manipulate a convention process to advance other amendments that suit their conservative agenda, he was concerned about what might come out of a “constitutional” convention. 
Paul pointed out that we are calling for an amendment convention, not a constitutional convention. Mr. Sullivan then asked us to share our perspectives on the issue.
Leo noted that an amendment convention is highly unikely to happen. When sufficient support for an amendment convention exists, Congress will pre-emptively propose an amendment, as happened with four of the past eleven amendments. Calling for an Amendment Convention is a means of ""upping the ante"" from the request made by the Commonwealth in 2012.
Mr. Sullivan brought up Common Cause, saying he has been a lifelong member, and indicated that their adamant opposition to an Article V “constitutional” convention was persuasive to him. 

Mike handed Mr. Sullivan two documents written by Wolf-PAC that refuted Common Cause's arguments point by point. David agreed to read them and consider their reasoning.

Mike noted that calls for an amendment are occurring in other states. He explained briefly how Common Cause had subverted such efforts in some other states.

John noted the business community does not require Constitutional protections to flourish.

Mr. Sullivan strongly advised us to work toward getting supporters of our position elected to Congress, rather than working toward an amendment convention.
Paul observed that most legislators go to Washington with the best of intentions, but cannot resist the political imperative to raise money to get re-elected, which inevitably affects their positions and voting on the issues. He said we need systemic change that only a constitutional amendment can provide.

He doesn't believe the root cause of Congress’s disability is campaign contributions. He doesn't believe a Constitutional Convention would help solve our problems.

He said that Aaron Miller (chair of election) is likely to be against this. In the past Miller was against a bill that Runestad introduced preventing legislators from becoming lobbyist for several years after serving. Suggested we needed to get Speaker Leonard on board to have success getting through committee. He wanted to look at legislation again so I emailed it to him. Overall I'd say he's supportive but not willing to put his name on it unless he thinks it will be successful. Willing to help though. ",1 - Supportive,MI

He told me that several years back he introduced legislation in the Montana legislature to remove dark money from politics. That legislation did pass, but the supreme Court overturned it. He also recounted his own experience fighting dark money in his senate race against a far-right Republican. I believe Jeff would be a good ally & would co-sponsor our resolution.

Duane Ankney,Anastasia Riojas,8/2/2017,Emailed legislator,"After doing a bit of research, I discovered that Ankney teamed up with Gov. Steve Bullock to fight ""dark money"" and push to pass the Montana Disclosure Act. Though transparency was the key component, it does prove that he as a Republican was willing to work with a Democrat to find a solution. It is also a step in the direction of Free and Fair, which I hope to get him to.

""Hello my name is Terrence Comella, I’m a voter in your district, and I’d like to talk to you about a resolution to restore free and fair elections across the country. The purpose of this resolution is to prevent the voice of the people from being distorted by Gerrymandered districts or muffled by million-dollar campaign contributions. 
This resolution calls for an amendment to the US Constitution because this issue is at the absolute heart of our republic. Since Congress will never bite the hand that feeds them we’re working to get this amendment through state legislatures. I believe that you can help create this much-needed change. We’re calling for an amendment convention that would create an amendment to insure free and fair elections. Could I meet with you to discuss this before the legislative session begins?""

Steve Yeager,Terrence Comella,1/13/2017,Met Legislator,I met with my Assemblyman at a coffee shop. We had a friendly conversation and he seemed generally supportive. He agreed with our general premise that our elections are fundamentally flawed and that Congress is unable to fix the problem.

Lesley Cohen,Ryan Tipton,7/7/2017,Met Legislator,We had a wonderful hour long conversation half of which was dedicated to Wolf-PAC and campaign finance. She was very receptive to my arguments against the runaway convention myth but wants to do her own research. She voted for SJR10 partly out of runaway convention fears. I gave her the executive summary of the DOJ report and encouraged her to read it as well as the 2016 CRS report. She is for campaign finance reform but wants to do due diligence in her own research of Article V. This was a very productive meeting.,2 - Not Confirmed,NV

He expressed some concerns, either related to the idea of other, bad ideas getting into a constitutional convention, or related to New Hampshire's charter. I mentioned that there are safeguards, specifically the need to ratify any constitutional amendment.

He is ok with unions contributing to campaigns, but he, like us, is strongly opposed to rich interests like corporations or the Koch Bro's influencing elections. He criticized the Koch's specifically and also mentioned the Supreme Court. I mentioned that curbing this kind of influence is what the amendment would be geared toward.

He seems to be leaning towards support, and also said that he thinks he supported last year's bill. I did try to mention that the wording is the same, but he didn't remember last year's bill very well. He didn't want to promise anything, but he did assure me that he would look in more detail at HCR 7.

After describing the bill to him, he curtly thanked me for telling me and was clearly not interested. I asked him if he would support, he said no. I politely asked why, he said why bother to spend the money and effort, he said amending with 3/4 the states is a better way. I thanked him for taking the time to talk to me.

His response confused me. As I understand it, 3/4 of the states is how you ratify an amendment, not how you propose one. So actually we aren't contradicting his view. Nonetheless, he is not at all interested in supporting us. He was guardedly polite, but it was obvious he has no interest in talking to voters.",3 - Unsupportive,NH

I was able to assuage many of his concerns (classic example of the opposition talking points) with the bullet points & info we've gone over, but the one thing I couldn't remember, & the last hold up I believe for him, was the process of choosing delegates. He is concerned that they would be cherry picked by the politicians in power, & may sneak things into the amendment that could effectively undermine the effort... I hope I'm conveying that properly. I told him I would look into the process of choosing delegates, but that any amendment would still need to be ratified by 3/4 of the states. Even so, he still wants to know about that part of it. I spoke with Eric about this after & he's been trying to help me find this information to pass on to Will, who gave me his cell # & is very receptive to additional information/further discussion on the issue. As it stands, however, he said he would not vote for it until he was sure. Will also said he reached out to Rep Smith in there interim between our emails & our meeting, but hadn't yet heard back. I believe a conversation with Tim could be what would ease his concern & tip him to a yes vote.",2 - Not Confirmed,NH
Timothy Josephson,Edwin Yu,10/2/2017,phone call with wife,"Grafton - District 11 (I could not find a district number out of 400)
I called around lunchtime, but it was a home number and he was out. Spoke with his wife, left message thanking him for supporting HCR 7.

Elizabeth Edwards,Edwin,10/2/2017,Phone call with Legislator,"(Hillsborough District 11)
I thanked her for her support. As I described the HCR 7 she recognized it, and told me that she remembered it because she doesn't get many bills like it in her committee (State-Federal Relations and Veterans Affairs). Then we spoke more generally about campaign finance reform bills, the election committee, and her committee. She then told me she recalled the day our bill came up, and we spoke briefly about the fact that our bill was tabled, and she recalled that many other bills were tabled that day as well. She expressed her disagreement with this practice, and her belief that bills need to get debated and addressed.

During our conversation, she did not criticize Article 5 nor did she mention any fear-mongering talking points. This leads to me to conclude that she is still supportive.",1 - Supportive,NH
Patricia Higgins,Edwin Yu,10/3/2017,Phone call with Legislator,"(Grafton District 12)
I thanked her for her support. She seemed to recognize the bill when I said HCR 7 and campaign finance reform. We discussed the fact that they tabled our bill. She told me it is difficult to find the right strategy and that she is working with Open Democracy. I have a suspicion that she might be thinking of HR 7 (which was a different bill related to campaign finance reform) rather than HCR 7, but in either case she supports campaign finance reform.",1 - Supportive,NH
Richard Abel,Edwin,10/3/2017,Phone call with Legislator,"(Grafton District 13)
I thanked him for his support. We discussed the fact that our bill was tabled and he spoke of the importance of giving a bill a vote instead of tabling it. Concerning the bill itself, he mentioned he was concerned about a convention getting into areas other than what the convention callers intended, and he asked my opinion. I mentioned that I had heard of that concern as well, and to my understanding the Department of Justice looked into this issue in the 80’s due to a movement among the states for a balanced budget amendment, and the DOJ concluded that a convention can, in fact be limited, and there are several ways to enforce this, one of which being the ratification process. He agreed that ratification was a relevant point to make. He reiterated his opinion that tabling a bill is a tricky way to get rid of/avoid a bill without going on record voting on it. Overall he has his doubts, but at least I was able to address them to some small extent. He asked if I had any other issues relating to the bill I wanted to discuss with him. I said that, since it was tabled, our bill would come up in some form in the future, and asked him if it was okay to give him a call then, he said yes.",2 - Not Confirmed,NH
Delmar Burridge,Edwin Yu,10/5/2017,Phone call with Legislator,"(Cheshire 16)
I thanked him for his support, I described the bill and asked him if it rang a bell. He might not have recognized the bill, but he spoke strongly in favor of campaign finance reform, and criticized, with specific examples, the influence of money in politics, mentioning efforts by the NRA in new Hampshire to fund opponents to gun control and intimidate people at hearings (he himself has been championing gun reform bills). 

He also mentioned that some legislators get funding from Washington, and come back and don’t represent their actual voters. I asked him if he would continue to support our bill going forward. He said it depended on the final language of the bill, he wanted to make sure first that no negative changes occurred to it. I thanked him for speaking to me and I thanked him for his efforts on gun reform. He also mentioned that Granny D once called him and he spoke positively of her and encouraged me to look up Granny D.",1 - Supportive,NH
Barbara Shaw,Edwin Yu,10/5/2017,Phone call with Legislator,"(Hillsborough 16)
I thanked her for support, she recognized the bill very quickly when I described it, she expressed strong support. She spoke of the wrongness of the influence of money in politics, particularly big money in presidential elections. She expressed her belief that a candidate needs to get out there and meet the voters, rather than rely on big money. I asked her if she would continue to be supportive, and she said absolutely, she would definitely vote to put an end to the influence of money in politics.",1 - Supportive,NH

I explained that our bill would come up again in the future and asked her if she would continue to support, and she spoke somewhat favorably, but she also said she’ll see what the committee says. 
She continued to speak with me about the issue of money in politics. She feels the influence of money is a problem in Congress, and she seems to support the idea of campaign finance reform, but she is amenable to the committee opinion, so we cannot assume she will continue to vote in our favor because the committee majority might not support us.

David Lisle,Edwin Yu,10/11/2017,Phone call with Legislator,"(Hillsborough 35)
I thanked him for his support, he let me know he is against the influence of money in politics and favors reform. 
I asked him if he would continue to support, he told me he is concerned with runaway convention, so he says he'll have to look at the bill when it comes up again and then decide. I mentioned DOJ and the issue of topic limitation, and the fact that more than the required number of states have called for a convention, but not enough on the same topic. He recognized that as the consensus principle. He still expressed concerns. 
He discussed with me further the problem of money in politics, and also had a long conversation with me about Nashua, specifically the upcoming municipal election. He is on our side for campaign finance reform, but he is concerned with runaway convention, so support is not guaranteed.",2 - Not Confirmed,NH

I thanked him for his support and we spoke about the bill. He did not really remember the bill. He is supportive of campaign finance reform to some extent, saying that he feels it’s ok if money comes from a broad spectrum, but he agreed that he does not like individual big donors with large influence. 

He says he feels an amendment is not the best method to address money in politics, he feels it is better to address campaign finance by statute. 
He supports a different article V for term limits. (says they have 28 states) He said he feels he wants to concentrate on article V for term limits, instead of also doing campaign finance reform, because he worries about going into multiple topics. I pointed out that it would be different conventions limited by topic. He went into other constitution topics, including issues he was worried about in New Hampshire. 
He feels term limits can address the problem of money’s influence to some extent, but he acknowledges that new politicians can also potentially be bought or influenced by money.

She does not think it can be limited to one topic. I mentioned the DOJ and the fact that we have more than 34 calls, but less than 34 for any one topic, so it has to be limitable or else we would already have to call a convention.

One of the audience members asked the panel why SJR-12 did not pass the House. McCamley told the audience of around 200 people that it's because they are afraid that groups like ALEC will hijack the convention, and we ""don't want a civil war."" I spoke with him after the event and tried to convince him that Article V conventions can be limited. He said he had spoken with several Harvard-educated lawyers, and they believed that there was no way that a convention can be limited. He said, it could open up the entire constitution for re-writing by ALEC. I also discussed the fact that there are hundreds of Article V applications out there, and the fact that there hasn't been a convention yet proves that it can be limited to one topic. He said he had spoken to NM Wolf PAC leadership and they ""admitted"" that there are in fact only 20 real Article V resolutions out there-- so even that argument hasn't been tested.",3 - Unsupportive,NM

He strongly suggested that we become familiar with the network of liberal activist groups that commonly interact with Democratic lawmakers, most of whom should be natural allies, and that we talk to them, get to know them, let them know we are not crazed radicals, and discuss with them why an Article V convention is not the danger that Common Cause, the ACLU, and labor unions say it is. He had a lot of good suggestions that Joseph wrote down in his notebook. He was really supportive of the idea of getting Rep.

Jim dines,Bill Spotz,5/11/2017,Met Legislator,"Great meeting. We spent almost no time discussing the “whys” of what we are doing because he completely agrees with us, understands why we are doing it, and is glad we are working on this issue. The majority of the meeting we spent discussing the specific politics of the NM legislature. We spent some time on the Senate — who voted for us and against us in which committee and on the floor. We spent more time talking about Brian Egolf and HJR10 (that rescinded existing Article V applications), and Gail Chasey and the House Judiciary Committee.

Positive results: Dines is totally supportive, and willing to talk to Republican lawmakers for us in an effort to broaden support.

Less positive results: Because sponsoring a bill requires a commitment of time on a legislator’s part, Dines is not yet willing to co-sponsor because without Egolf, he does not believe it will go anywhere. Also, for Democrats worried about the right wing hijacking the process, a Republican sponsor might be detrimental.

Bill McCamley,Sergio Olivas,8/18/2017,Met Legislator,"He supports the strategy 100%. His only reservation is the timing. For him, we can have all of the legal arguments on our side to support a limited convention to address campaign finance, but that doesn't matter if we don't have the numbers. His experience in the NM House when it was R controlled convinced him that numbers (R v D) triumphs logical arguments. He says ALEC has the numbers and influence to pervert justices and legislators into interpreting Art V or the FFER into anything they want. It doesn't matter the arguments; it's the numbers. It's a strategy he can't support NOW. I dropped the 700 applications counter-arguments but that didn't seem to register. He did appreciate my passion on the issue and said that although he can't do it now, he hopes I keep pursuing addressing this issue.",3 - Unsupportive,NM

It is not just fear that the convention will runaway or open up the Constitution, but that Republicans will have the numbers to get away with it.

He made an interesting request: he would like to see a list of Republican lawmakers from around the country, especially deep red states, who are like-minded with us and of good faith on the issue of money-out-of-politics.

Joanne Ferrary,Ali Scotten,9/12/2017,Met Legislator,"WP volunteer Fred Rabert and I met with Ferrary and her legislative aide/campaign advisor. She had supported our resolution last year, but like most everyone, she had been contacted by CC and was concerned about the runaway threat. We discussed the arguments in favor of keeping an Article V convention limited. But then I focused mostly on the high ratification threshold. I told her that personally, if the only safeguard against ALEC shredding the Bill of Rights was the belief that the convention could be limited, I would not be here today--because even the 1% chance that the convention could go off the rails is too much of a risk for me. But since we would only need 13 states to block a crazy amendment (and we have 18 states that would do that currently --13 Dem controlled and 5 split), this is why I am still here pushing this strategy. I said that I sympathize with CC's concerns because I have no faith in the Republicans' desire to play fair --just look at what they did with the Supreme Court. But I think CC focuses too much on the runaway fear and ignores the high bar of ratification. Ferrary's aide asked if it was in the Constitution that you needed 3/4 of the states to ratify an amendment--which shows to me that there is a lack of knowledge among our state legislators about the way the federal government works, which makes sense since they have to only focus on state-level issues. But this lack of knowledge is how CC can frighten them. Ferrary was very impressed with the argument and came around to supporting us. She said, I'm a supporter of CC, but no organization can be right about everything. We also discussed how Egolf is currently in a blanket anti-Article V mood.

Bill Tallman,Tabitha Hrynick,5/4/2017,Met Legislator,"Bill Spotz and I met w/ Tallman at cafe. It was clear his supportive vote during the session was a party vote. He did not have knowledge of how Article V worked, and while he certainly felt money in politics was a problem, he might be susceptible to opposition lobbying as he had questions about Article V. While he was open and receptive to our arguments for it, and we gave him a Democrat info packet, as well as copies of the articles by Alison and Mike which he said he would read, we must follow up with him later on to ensure his continued support. Despite his questions, I'm inclined to say he would still support the Resolution, but again, requires follow up. ",1 - Supportive,NM

The meeting was very short as he was already a #1. He said he would vote for the resolution, but would not sponsor or co-sponsor. He is very nice, and very to the point. He said he supports this bill, but would not want to put his name because he views it as telling national politicians what to do. He says he has very good rapport with nation politicians, talks to them once a day, and thinks the are competent in their roles. He also mentioned, that even if he did co-sponsor it, it would only be symbolic, and it wouldn't mean anything, because he knows it will pass in the assembly again with no problem.",1 - Supportive,NY

We explained the bill, it's need, bi-partisan nature, and the workings of the convention. He had a couple of simple questions, but we answered. We asked him why he got involved in politics, and he mentioned he was a dairy farmer at one time, and that the local legislators were going to hurt the dairy farming business, so he ran against them and won. We mentioned that by his own example, he understands how it feels to be unrepresented.

We did explain that this was something that was dealing with Congress (Federal) reforms, also he was concerned about the influence of money and lobbies on representatives sent to the Article V Convention.

Inez Dickens,Earl Myers,1/3/2017,Emailed legislator,"Heard back from her Chief of Staff. Here' what the email said:

Greetings Earl,

On behalf of New York State Assembly Member Inez E. Dickens, I would like to thank you for expressing your support of a resolution for Free and Fair Elections to ensure that corporate money is not the catalyst for how campaigns are won or lost. It is an issue that has dogged many state and federal elections and has distanced the average voter from participating in the electoral process. 

However, we need more support from concerned citizens like yourself. The Assembly Member needs more active voices who are just as eager to see this resolution move forward to demonstrate its importance. Her community has forcefully come out in support of affordable housing, healthcare, mental health and senior services, as well as education, which has provided us with the support necessary to make much needed changes. To hear from them on this issue would be just as vital.

Recently, our office met with a number of concerned citizens not from our area (Wolf PAC Inc.) who are looking to create Free and Fair Elections in NY. They understand the issue cannot make it through this present Congress unless the states take it upon themselves to remedy. They understand if enough states pass such legislation, Congress will be forced to act. It would be a game changer to have New York added to the list of states that are willing stop the money from corrupting political influence. But it can’t be done unless more voices are heard.

We need theirs as much as yours to help see it through. 

Regards,

Lermond Mayes
Chief of Staff

Jenne,Glen Fabisevich,10/17/2017,Phone call with staff,"Had a long talk (over 30 minutes) with Judy Aldrich, staffer in DO. We had a long conversation about the script and language, and she gave her philosophy on how to appeal to people when convincing them to vote for a resolution. First, make it personal. Why is the resolution important to us personally, and to our friends and community? Secondly, since the States work with the Federal Government, we should speak about outside interests contributing with their money rather than anything the Federal Government is doing (which is something I said when I started to ""make it personal""). Don't create barriers for ourselves which we'll have to get over. 

She spoke about her 30 years as a small time dairy farmer and how working through good and bad times created her vision for how things should be done. In our case, I believe it means that what we go through together and how we communicate with legislative offices can be the difference between passing and not passing. She gets 110 of these scripted calls per day, and from being on both sides of legislating and being on the business end, she's noted that it's the personal stories that wake others up to the issues which are important to them.

""I actually agree with the Citizens United decision that making contributions to campaign funding is a matter of free speech. As for myself, a lot more money has been spent against me, just in the primaries, than I have raised for primaries and general elections put together. That doesn’t bother me. It shows how desperate my opponents are and bleeds their resources a bit. Since I have beaten them so far, I hope it also gives them a big sense of frustration. Money isn’t everything. I have proven that repeatedly. But I simply don’t believe you will get a majority to go along with limiting people’s right to give to whatever campaigns they choose, and I don’t think that effort is worthy of my time. As for the Article V convention idea, I don’t trust it. We do not have as well-informed an electorate today as when that was adopted; nor do we have as many trustworthy elected officials. It is my understanding that enemies of America, such as George Soros, are pushing this just as hard as some true patriots. They must have a plan that would be no good for us. Regardless of all the touted safeguards, there is nothing to stop such a convention, in our day, from going rogue and throwing out the Constitution in its entirety if they so choose. It is too big a risk for us to take under the current circumstances of low information voters and unscrupulous politicians. So I will not support it.""

He said that there is quite some opposition about the process in the Republican caucus. He said that he thought we should try to get behind another issue that has a chance of making it to convention, in order to ease the fears about the process. He thinks that a balanced budget ammendment would be more popular. I shared that it would seem that campaign finance reform is THE single issues that the majority of Americans agree needs to be addressed. He said that he respectfully disagrees. I shared that there is momentum behind our call for a convention nationally with 4 states having passed the bill and it being introduced in over 30 other states.

LaTourette tells me that in committee, which usually doesn't hold up many things, HJR2 is getting held up due to runaway concerns from both liberal and conservative legislators. She thinks our resolution may be even more difficult as the issue turns off republican even more.

Of course he was reserved about the idea and suggested different avenues to tackle the problem. I responded very simply and that Wolf-Pac is focused on this avenue (Article V). I kind of said that Even If this is not the best in your eyes at least we are talking about it and coming to the conclusion that there is an issue that needs to be fixed. (I am a little green and need more practice) I also said that an Article V would be a great way to by pass the Federal government which seems to be only in support of special interests and will not appropriately balance the budget as an example. We disagree that Article V will lead to a run away back I countered that by stating that if it did turn into a run away than there would be little chance that the amendment would be ratified. A focused amendment on one topic will more likely succeed therefore a run away would result in nothing but bring awareness to the problem. I sent a follow up email with the proposed document and waiting for a response.

2) Set up lunch w/ George Phillips, Greenspan's ""district director"" and ""communications director,"" (also personal friend and director of career cervices at Notre Dame college) for week of May 15th.
3) Exchanged contact info w/ Greenspan's campaign director Bill White. (I think White is Greenspan's legislative director or chief of staff b/c he was knowledgeable about policy. Will set up meeting week of May 15th.

Side note 1 - Met fellow volunteers Chris Fockler and Kyle Collins. Both incredibly nice guys and well briefed on our resolution. Chris clearly communicated a convincing argument for how the current campaign finance system hurts small business, based on demand side economic theory. (I was blown away). Kyle, VERY succinctly and professionally dispatched all DOJ talking points to a room of 25+, in response to a runaway convention claim. (I was blown away).

Side note 2 - Met Eric Tuck (exchanged business cards) and Kerry (exchanged email), both are interested in learning about wolf-pac. Also, was asked if wolf-pac volunteers are interested in attending various league of women voters meeting and events. (I'm following up)

Steven Arndt,Tim Graham,5/18/2017,Phone call with staff,"Legislative Aide Joe Bizjack: 

Joe said he reviewed the information with Rep. Arndt. He said that there was already an Article V resolution (HJR 2) that was in committee with the Federalist and Interstate Relations that is led by Rep. Roegner. 

He recommended that we add our issue as an amendment to that. He recommended that I email her to add myself to the email notice list (and I did). 

I did explain to him that our Article V was for a limited Article V and the DOJ Letter gives explanation how this is important. I said since Rep. Arndt isn't opposed to using Article V as a tool, that he would probably want to use it in a limited capacity targeted at a focused issue. He acknowledged that. 

I also explained how I understand that a state can have multiple Article V resolutions with different focused issues. I explained that I understood that to get the 2/3 of states, the Article V resolutions must all be for the same issue. 

Joe mentioned that he is Rep. Arndt's only Legislative Aide. He said that their current priorities are dealing with Davis Bessie and meeting with Senate colleagues to advocate for School Funding. 

I let Joe know that I would research HJR2 and confer with our group to determine whether this was a viable alternative path. I said that if we determine that we don't think that is the best way to go I would follow up with him again. 

I had asked him if the Article V was for balanced budget, which I think we've discussed in the group before. I found this resolution and it is ""Application to the Congress of the United States for a Convention of the States under Article V of the Constitution of the United States that is limited to proposing amendments that impose fiscal restraints on the federal government, limit the power and juristiction of the federal government, and limit the terms of office for its officials and Members of Congress.""",N/A,OH

We brought up her campaign for Ohio Secretary of State, and while our resolution lines up very well with her efforts ideologically, the political implications of supporting it during her SoS campaign could be odd. Pete said the best way to discuss with her is face to face, which I've been trying to do for a long time. We asked if he knew of strategic republicans to approach, he said he'd have to think and come up with some later. She will be proposing some sort of election reform bill after the recess.",2 - Not Confirmed,OH
Dorothy Pelanda,Alexis Alberts,6/28/2017,Met with staff,"CAD meeting: Alexis Alberts, Jimmy Hull, and Garrett Baldwin met with aide Todd Thatcher. This was a first contact with the office, so we discussed the resolution and its call for an AVC. Todd said that the Rep. would be ""open"" to discussing the issue of campaign finance, but has Art V concerns. We asked what those concerns might be, and we brought up the BBA (SJR1 and HJR2). Todd said that he'd have to let Pelanda review our resolution before we discussed her concerns. We briefly discussed Pelanda's plans to run for Secretary of State. We briefly discussed OK Sen. Tom Coburn's efforts to get an Art V resolution passed in his state. There was ambiguity around this at the time of the meeting, but we later researched and realized that Todd may have been equating our efforts with Convention of States. Todd told us to follow up in ""a couple of weeks."" We need to make clear to Pelanda that our resolution is totoally different from CoS and BBA; that we are totally different organizations. Pelanda and her staff seem not to know much about AVCs, so there's some opportunity here. 

Pelanda's aide implied that she would likely support our cause, but she may have concerns about our method. ",2 - Not Confirmed,OH

He mentioned Reineke's family business: auto dealerships. He mentioned that Reineke has never ""had to personally worry"" about campaign finance, because he doesn't need to rely on donations (because of aforementioned business). Eric said he'd pass along our materials to the representative, and that we could follow up in the coming weeks, but that we might have better luck in the fall. 

No idea if the rep is supportive of AVCs, and it sounds like when it comes to campaign finance reform, he's indifferent at best. We still need to confirm his support level and gauge opportunity for persuasion.",2 - Not Confirmed,OH
Robert McColley,Alexis Alberts,6/28/2017,Met with staff,"CAD: Alexis, Jimmy, and Garrett met with aide Margaret. We explained our resolution and its call for an AVC. Margaret would not discuss what McColley's perspective might be, but she did say that she personally sees the campaign finance system as complex, with many regulations in place. We asked Margaret what McColley's pet issues are, and she explained that because he is from the northwestern-most district, he's competitive with adjacent states when it comes to things like tax policy. She reminded us that he's chair of the transportation finance committee.

I explained that the reason we keep it more broad is bc the delegates need to decide how best to bring about change, not us. He also thought that stating the goal of ""overturning Citizens United"" was not good (since he believes it is a free speech issue). He believes in more transparency but not necessarily limiting donations. He also had issues with the 8th paragraph on delegate selection. He thinks we need to be more clear on that. He did not think that the gov represents special interests more than regular ppl so I gave him the Gilens n Page article to read. He supports the Balanced Budget Art V res and said that he wants to focus on one Art V convention at a time instead of multiple ones bc it might be confusing for ppl.

I then talked about Wolf-PAC and our resolution, and he seemed to perk up, mentioning that he knew about us and the Article V convention. He mentioned a bill had been written and was about to be voted on, but he wasn't clear on it. I suspect he's talking about a different Article V resolution, but he wasn't certain at this point. He said he spoke with our lead organizer. He voluntarily shared details about the Art V convention, which suggested that he understood some of its details, and seemed open to what we're proposing. He made it clear to me that he didn't feel comfortable attaching his name to ""hypothetical legislation,"" but that he would take it more seriously once it hits the floor. He requested a copy of our resolution and its language. I emailed this to him, and he said he would follow up with me later to discuss whether or not this is something he could support.",2 - Not Confirmed,OH

She said that he is still reviewing it closely, but after discussing it with his staff, he seemed to think that this is more of a federal issue and that I should reach out to them. I emphasized to her that this approach is specifically for the states to call for a convention in the event that the American people could not depend on Congress to amend the Constitution, as has been done with over half of our amendments in which the states called for a convention, citing the specifics regarding the 17th amendment and why this approach is so important because it directly impacts Congress' self-interests. It is our right and responsibility to use this method when the people believe the Constitution should be amended, with or without Congress' support. She said that this would be good for Representative Barnes to hear and that she will try to get him to call me back later today to discuss this. I also brought up meeting for CAD and she said to email her details on CAD. This line of thinking--that this is a federal issue--is similar to Rep.

John Barnes,Bob Richardson,9/21/2017,Phone call with Legislator,"I had an interesting conversation with Rep. Barnes. He started off the conversation by dominating the conversation, and I aggressively tried to get my points in. This did not have initial success, as he insisted on finishing what he had to say, but he eventually acquiesced and allowed me to speak. He then said he had limited time and was headed out of the office, but we talked for a good while after this. Important things he mentioned included:

- Five groups across nation trying to get this passed, and that different language in different states will not move our resolution forward, meaning it is symbolic in nature and won't amount to a ""Constitutional Convention,"" which he kept calling it and I corrected him on.
- Supreme Court ruled that corporations are people--and that he's as unhappy about that as I am--and because of that they can deem the amendment e're fighting for unconstitutional.
- He has no time at all to introduce this or sponsor it as that takes time away from his bills fighting for jobs and education.
- Impossible to get passed given the current climate in Columbus.
- There's simply no time this year to get this passed and maybe next year is better.

When he let me talk, I responded to these points by stating that the resolution is for Free and Fair Elections and that resolutions passed in other states would be consistent with our own. I stated that the Supreme Court cannot find an amendment unconstitutional because it becomes a part of the unconstitutional, and he insisted that this is not the case and it'll get thrown out. I further commented that this is a topic that has been reviewed by legal minds in the past and that the Supreme Court does not have the authority. I stated further that to do this is the whole point of amending the Constitution through Article V as it is for the people to go around the federal gov't for what 75% of the states view as necessary. He literally responded by telling me that is not correct and the Supreme Court has that authority, beginning to take an authoritative tones, so I let that rest and moved on. I insisted then that this is the most important issue right now and it is worth his time, because everything he is trying to get done now and in the future is impacted by money in politics. I also stated that if he is worried about the time investment, we are not asking him to introduce the resolution or even sponsor it, but would like to know if he could support it once it hits the floor. He said in firm, slow words, referencing that he told this to me last week (which he did), that he does NOT support hypothetical legislation and it doesn't make sense for him or any other legislator to vocally support something that hasn't even been written yet. I asked him if he'd be willing to help the LSC write the language, and there was a long pause. He then returned to the point of not having the time. I then asked if he supported what we're proposing conceptually, and he reiterated that he can't support something conceptually that hasn't been written. I rephrased and asked if he supported getting money out of politics and felt this was an important issue, and he said, ""Of course."" Note for future volunteers--this ""hypothetical legislation"" is a very important point to Rep. Barnes. When talking about the climate in Columbus, I said we have bipartisan support from leadership on both sides of the aisle who enthusiastically support what we're trying to do. I mentioned Tavares and Peterson. He seemed interested in this point, but did not comment too much. At this point, he said he had to get to his next meeting. I closed by thanking him emphatically for his time and respect, and that I appreciate all of his efforts and that I am proud to have him representing my district. He was very grateful for the kind words and mentioned grabbing coffee with me once back in district. I made sure to do this given research that indicated he has had problems within the Democratic party and may be in need of kind words! He agreed to meet with us during CAD and I set up a meeting time. I urge those meeting with him to review these notes closely.",2 - Not Confirmed,OH

Bill Patmon,Alexis Alberts,9/20/2017,Met Legislator,"Martin Keeley and I met with Rep. Patmon and aide Alex Strickmaker. We started the meeting by discussing the article that Patmon co-wrote with Rep. Hagan published 9-18-17. Rep. Patmon said that putting his name on the article isn't a big deal for him, because he's been a proponent of calling for an Article V convention for ""a few years now."" We asked what Article V resolutions or efforts Patmon supports, and he indicated that he's fully on board with Convention of States and the Balanced Budget efforts. When we asked why that resolution appeals to Patmon and why he thinks it'll be successful, he said that the concept of a balanced budget is something everyone can agree on, across the nation. I mentioned that our resolution is more focused and limited than the BB, and Patmon posed the question, “how do you separate the issues of campaign finance reform and balancing the budget?” He explained that we will likely only get one chance at an Article V convention. He then discussed cutting the EPA and the Dept. of Education, along with a few other disjointed points of conversation. We asked who Patmon would recommend as potential sponsors, and he mentioned Huffman in the Senate, but didn’t mention anyone in the House. Aide Alex told me to call Friday about setting up a meeting for Tuesday 9/26 CAD. // Martin’s notes: Patmon did not seem enthusiastic about our cause. He expressed concerns that special interest groups could still spend a lot of money on commercials. He said that we would have to cover all aspects of campaign finance because we could not go back in a year or two and revise it.But the way he said it sounded like he didn't think it could be done. He is more interested in BBA but he did say he would support us.

Wes Retherford,Martin Keeley,9/20/2017,Met Legislator,"Alexis and I met with Retherford in his Columbus office.
Retherford mentioned right away that he still has hesitations about Article V conventions. He did a quick internet search for Article V and started reading the language to us. He lingered on the language about Congress choosing the mode of ratification. He also expressed discomfort with the lack of explicit time frame for Congress to call a convention. Conversation turned to a runaway convention, and when Martin mentioned ratification as a safeguard against a runaway, Retherford explained that the people who attend an Art V conference will likely be politically savvy and will be able to persuade across states' borders. We brought up the way delegates will likely be selected, and Retherford repeated the idea that all of the discussion surrounding Article V is theoretical. 
Retherford expressed concerns that Congress could somehow control the convention 
I also have notes about what he mentioned that indicate his political disposition. He expressed the idea that apathy on the part of the citizens contributes equally with big donations to the corruption we see in federal politics.I tried to make the point that much of the voter apathy is because of the big donations that cause the corruption in the federal government, that people feel that they have no influence in what happens there. He seems to place responsibility on the individual, rather than the system. If we can find a way to appeal to that, and to quell his concerns about a runaway convention/Congress controlling or impeding the convention, we could likely get him on board as supporting, if not co-sponsoring.

Alex was more blunt and to the point than rep Patmon, who is generally quiet and has a rough edge, but Alex said not to take this as a bad sign. Alex went on to say that we needed to be more focused in our arguments for pitching campaign finance reform to legislator we are targeting, such as outside money influencing elections. He then talked about how Ohio is big on transparency, where we used to be 48 in the country, we are now 2. This was because the sponsor for our resolution won't necessarily be a delegate at the convention, so they need to be very passionate and be doing it to become a delegate. While Patmon has about 16 bills as well as committees he's on, which isn't unusual, one more resolution isn't a big issue. Patmon wants things coming though his office to be successful. Alex will check with Patmon about drafting our resolutions language through LSC. Alex recommends we talk to Hagan and Huffman, but Hagan is less likely to help much since she is running for a congressional seat, so it would be best to wait until that is finished to approach her since Hagan probably doesn't want to leave us high and dry. Since we need a republican to sponsor for our resolution to go anywhere Patmon we won't have sponsor. Also Patmon is term limited, so we only have 1 year and 3 months with him. We will follow up in a week.",1 - Supportive,OH

Dan Ramos,Martin Keeley,9/26/2017,Met with staff,"Kyle and I met with Ramos' aid and after giving him a copy of our Resolution he asked if there were any changes in it.He implied that Ramos was still in support of our issue. He suggested we speak with Representatives Retherford and Hagan. I told him we had talked to Retherford and are working on addressing his concerns and that Hagan is focused on the BBA. He also said that if we want to find Republican sponsors that we should talk to the more right wing members of the party in Ohio who have a tendency to buck their own party. But I think we don't want Representative who will buck their own party, we want Representatives who will bring the party with them. He asked if we could do a union with the Convention of the States people, and I explained that while we could decide to lend support to their push, or they could decide to lend support to ours, we could not do a united resolution as the resulting language would be too dissimilar to the language of the Resolutions that both our supporting states and their supporting states had already passed and that all those states would have to repass resolutions with the new language.",1 - Supportive,OH

Michael Ashford,Martin Keeley,9/26/2017,Met with staff,"Cad meeting Kyle and I met with Ashford's aid Vincent. . Vincent asked a lot of questions, basically wanting us to run through the nuts and bolts of how our resolution worked. Kyle explained what the goal was, the entire process of how an Article V convention works, and that we are not proposing solutions to the problem of money and politics at this stage, as those will be discussed at the convention and that the resolution is merely meant to get the convention called.I explained to him about the fears of a runaway convention when he asked what sort of push back we often get on it and Kyle explained that the an Article V convention would be limited to just the issue of campaign finance reform and that they would not be allowed to discuss other issues. Kyle also explained that the ratification threshold means that whatever comes out of the convention cannot be too radical or it would not get ratified. He asked if this had ever been done before, and we explained that it hadn’t, but that was because whenever an issue gets close to the required number of states, Congress usually drafts an amendment themselves and that half of our current amendments came about in this way. Kyle also explained that that means that if the preference is to go through Congress, this would be an effective means of signalling to them that this is an issue of importance and lighting a fire under them to get them to address it. We gave him the Resolution, the polling data on the issue of money in politics, and the DOJ report and he asked if we had polling data from the State of Ohio specifically, which we admitted we did not as our only data currently is from a national poll. He also asked for a list of what states had passed the resolution, which we gave him, and of states that had come close to passing, which we did not have. He also asked how many states we were active in and we said all of them.I told him I would call the end of the week about setting up a meeting with Representative Ashford.",2 - Not Confirmed,OH

John Patterson,Ted Gurrola,9/27/2017,Met Legislator,"Martin keeley and I met with Rep Patterson who is extremely in favor of our movement. Previously, Patterson has cosponsored a very similar resolution to ours in GA 130, HJR4, which also called an article V convention to address money in politics. he also voted in favor of the balanced budget convention resolution in GA 130. In our discussion, Patterson started off by stated citizens united bothered him because little folks aren't heard due to it. He agrees that big money is a huge problem in politics, and then Patterson brought up Kent state because we were talking about income inequality and he asked do they, meaning the people in Washington, want the people in this country to get that angry?

He isn't in favor of an open convention like the one Huffman is proposing, but rather that the convention needs to be more targeted to one issue. ""If you open the door that wide, you don't know what will come through"". He went on to mention that potential republican sponsors might be Dever, Hagan, Roegner, or Householder. When we told him Roegner had been turned off to the idea of a convention because of the BB discussion, he mentioned that was probably due to the BB being a much more open convention. He thinks the core group of republicans won't support our resolution unless moderate republicans or republican mavericks support first. 

Patterson went on to discuss how income has not increased since the 70s and that parents allowed families to live and live well off 1 income. Now only 1 parent working is not an option. He agrees that when special interests give millions to politicians they get trillions back in tax cuts. In regard to the BB resolutions, he acknowledged that in order for our country to invest, we needed to borrow money sometimes. Also, he was afraid of what we would cut to balance the budget. 

Patterson was strongly in favor of our agenda and advised us to send him our resolution when it was officially drafted by rep dever so he could advise and help rewrite it if necessary to be more successful. From there he would help it along as much as he could so that it passed. He said republicans in their hearts believe in our ideas, but that politically it isn't always in their best interests to take the moral high ground. Patterson isn't afraid of debate, but if our issue gets debated on the floor of the chamber we will lose because a bill very rarely does not pass if it gets to the floor. If there is still debate on the floor, after the debates of the committee hearings, we might have a problem. He can help round up support, and said his best work goes unseen.

He then talked about the committee process. Saying that there usually isn't debate in committee, just questions. He suggested we should construct our argument in committee so majority party will easily conform it to their world view. That we should get rid of the states we have already passed because they are democrat controlled. Even Illinois, because Obama is from there. Even if we say we are nonpartisan, perception is more important than reality, he argued. Next, he advised us to have as little information in our resolution as possible, so there are less ""bones to pick apart"". 

He went on to talk about Kasich and how he might be a player. Kasich might be in favor of our resolution because the BB passed two years ago thanks to Kasich's pushing for it. As well, Kasich might run for president again and/or governor and this is a very popular issue to run on. Patterson also recommended Nickie Antonio in the democratic leadership as someone who would support us, because she believes in fair government. For some reason he quickly switched gears and made the argument that it would be better to have states pass election reform at their level. However, I argued that congress would not be swayed by this to solve the problem, first because they haven't solved it already meaning they are either unwilling or unable to do so and second because they did not solve the problem of a balanced budget when 32 states called for one. even after passing gramm-rudman, we now have 20 trillion dollars in debt. he agreed with all these points and went back to agreeing completely with our idea of how to fix the problem and that we should send him our official draft language to him as soon as we have it so he can help rewrite it where necessary.",1 - Supportive,OH

David Leland,Martin Keeley,9/28/2017,Met Legislator,"Spoke to Leland briefly at the end of a town hall and asked him about his views on our Resolution. He has a list of concerns as follows.Afraid of a runaway convention. Thinks convention will turn into 1787 convention where the delegates rewrite the rules of the convention and will rewrite the constitution. 
Thinks that since every state will get only one vote that small states will take control of the convention, and only a small minority of the population will get what they want 
Also thinks that congress won't ratify anything that would hurt them.
Agrees we need to solve the problem of money in politics, but thinks the way to do this is by changing the way we elect people by changing to a popular vote system and getting rid of the electoral college. 
In the federalism committee, Leland is a big opponent of the COS resolution, so it would look bad for him to be against that because of runaway concerns and be in favor of another article V convention call. I did not have the time to fully address all of his concerns so we need to put together a response to all his concerns and set another meeting with him to address them.

I told her when there is more time we can discuss potential co-sponsors we've talked to in the house, and also opposition groups that will inevitably get involved at some point. She agreed thoroughly, and wants to meet sometime around December once Dever's draft is in hand. She has done some research on the topic outside of our talks, and says it's the moral right thing to do, so I think she is taking this very seriously. She cannot attend this Friday's meetup, but she wants to be invited to future meetups.

Jay Edwards,Martin Keeley,10/18/2017,Met with staff,"Representative Edwards was tied up in a committee hearing so we met with his aid Jacob, who Kyle and I had spoken to at CAD. We explained what we were trying to do and he asked what we would change about the system. WE told him we wanted to have the convention to start the conversation where all ideas on how to address the problem could be discussed. Representative Edwards sponsored a bill to deal with the opioid epidemic, Daniel,s Law, so we talked about the lack of action in Washington to deal with the opioid crisis because of all the money the pharmaceutical companies give to the politicians there.Jacob talked about issue 2 which he thinks will be defeated because of all the money going into the campaign against it.I told him about Devers drafting the language but we still are looking for a sponsor, and that Devers had suggested Brinkman , and others had suggested Householder. He said Edwards works closely with Householder and could help us get a meeting.Jacob said he was surprised how much Edwards was in favor of our resolution and thinks he may even sponsor.",1 - Supportive,OH
Doug Green,Martin Keeley,10/18/2017,Met Legislator,"The main take away from our meeting with rep Green was that he will keep an open mind and talk to his fellow reps, but won't say yes or no to our resolution yet. He is concerned that not allowing for private financing of elections will make it much more difficult to unseat an incumbent, since they will already have so much name recognition you won't be able to raise enough money to get the word out about yourself. We said in response that big money could be what gets a rep reelected. 

Green went on to discuss how disgraceful it was how much money was going into elections, agreeing with our point that it was like an arms race. He then asked if we would be able to address PAC's, because we don't know who is donating to campaigns, as well as why we were not pursuing an article 9 convention. We said we could talk about transparency at the convention, but we didn't know what an article 9 convention was. 

Green has some concerns about the convention having a limited scope, because it has been a concern in the past. But this was not a big deal for him. He thinks that if the federal government had to live under the same ethics rules as Ohio, for example reps need to disclose when they are given sports tickets, then the federal government would change. He went on to talk about how Rep Pelanda once dated a lobbyist a few years back and since there were ethics concerns the speaker said to marry him, so she did.

Green agrees there is way more money going into the federal level. But thinks lobbying community in ohio wants to push agendas that are good for their constituents, like us. He also agrees that solving the issue of money in politics will help the balanced budget.",2 - Not Confirmed,OH
Tim Schaffer,Martin Keeley,10/18/2017,Met with staff,"Representative Schaffer was held up in another meeting so we spoke with his aid Mark. He wanted to know what states we already passed in and who in the state was supporting us.We gave him the list of states that have passed and stated that Ma was having hearing on it now. I gave him a list of Representatives who are supporting and Ted gave a list of Senators. He said it was good to also have the list of Senators because Schaffer had previously served in the Senate and knows a lot of them.I told him about Devers drafting the language but we are still looking for a sponsor. He said he is pretty sure the Rep. would support this, but he has only worked for Schaffer for five months and they have never discussed the issue of money in politics. He will pass on our information to Schaffer and see if he has any questions. . Mark recommends talking to members of the government oversight committee in the house since they know a lot about the issue and typically are more interested in ways to address government oversight.

David Leland,Martin Keeley,10/24/2017,Met Legislator,"We met Representative Leland at his Columbus office. Leland supports what we are trying to do concerning campaign finance reform, but he does not trust any aspect of an article V convention. He gave examples of how he thought it could go astray at every step in the process, and no points we made to address them could change his view. He is a big opponent of the COS resolution and thinks it would be hypocritical of him to then support our resolution.He also said he did not think our resolution will get anywhere in our Republican controlled Legislature.He did say he would like to see the resolution when it comes out of the LSC. Here are some of his views Leland thinks that 34% of the country will control the rest of the population at the convention because small states get the same representation as large states, similar to electing trump
He thinks the way to solve the problem is to make sure we elect the right people, like getting rid of electoral college
Thinks that we could pass an amendment that is popular but was not the purpose for calling the convention, like a convention called to address campaign finance reform but comes up with an amendment to abolish the electoral college. He philosophically opposes this since it is technically a runaway.
He understands that the 1787 convention was not an article V convention, since it did not exist yet, but says that it shows a convention called for one purpose can go beyond that purpose
He does not think that now is the best time to propose fundamental change to our guiding principles since he thinks for the first time in a long time we are questioning who we are as a people.
Doesn't think people who voted for BB understood the implications of what they were voting for and did not take it seriously. Now, however, they are taking the Article V convention calls seriously.
Doesn't think money in politics is an institutional problem, used the example of Watergate and how legislation was proposed after that event to impose more regulation

Scott Lipps,Theodore Gurrola,10/31/2017,Met Legislator,"Lipps was stuck in committee so we started the meeting off by talking to Lipps' Sam. We didn't think the committee would take long because they were only discussing a ""fuzzy puppy bill"" and a bill regulating home inspectors. Sam thought that the COS push would be far right, but Rep. Becker, the most conservative member of GA, will vote against it. Sam also thought that the tea party would never get anything done or have real power because they wont compromise. Then Lipps arrived and started discussing COS. Lipps is a very honest and outspoken person, which made it easier to relate to him than most legislators. He is also very nice and weird in a good way. He described himself as loud, which was accurate, but for our purposes not a bad thing. For the COS resolution, Lipps said Roegner would not call it to a vote until she knew they had the votes to pass it, so she wanted the support of becker and zeltwanger. Becker most likely won't change his mind, but zeltwanger says he will vote for COS but won't guarantee it to Roegner. Lipps also said Holmes will vote for it because even though he is a dem. he is a gun carrier. However, Rep.s Young, Leland, and ashford will vote against COS. He also said Roegner would be unavailable in 90 days because of her senate run and her primary challenge. 
Talking more about himself again he described his pharmacy bill, and his thought that issue 2 was the wrong answer (his district is the epicenter of the opioid crisis in ohio so he takes it very seriously) Lipps said he will probably become the federalism committee chair, and when he does he will ask a strong member of the committee to sponsor our resolution and then he wants to help us line up cosponsors, essentially he wants to help orchestrate this effort behind the scenes, but only if we get leadership on board like the speaker. Or maybe we could get zeltwanger to sponsor. When we get the draft language back from LSC, Lipps wants us to send it to his aide, Sam, right away. To have a better chance of passing lipps advised us to help the COS push pass, even if we are advocating just for the same method, so we can ride on its coat tails. We will have a much harder time if it fails.
When we asked about the April 1st deadline for getting introduced, where we are guaranteed a hearing, Lipps said this was not at all true. NO BILL is guaranteed a committee hearing, it depends on leadership. For this we need to go to the speaker of the house, which will likely be Rep Ryan smith in 2019. According to lipps, if he is not for our resolution, we need to get passed this session, before smith starts as speaker, so we have a chance. To get Smith on our side, Lipps suggested we feed his ego, play nice, but smith might not admit to a speaker ambition. 
Lipps went on to talk about predatory lending being allowed in ohio, and how the loans were almost all owned by new York. (this might be a useful framing for republicans) When we do talk to zeltwanger, we should not bring up lipps's name, because lipps pointed out that zeltwanger was 98th in attendance last year, so he does not like lipps. Lipps also said that if we want support it is best to go to the house of reps. He says ""bills come from the peoples house and they die in the senate, both at the state and federal level.""
When we talked about how difficult it was to get meetings with some people, lipps used his own schedule as to how busy reps are, he was going from 9am until 11pm. and senators have districts 3 times the size of reps so they are even busier. So they aren't always trying to avoid us, but it is easier to get meetings when it is a constituent asking.
When we asked him for names to help draft in the senate, he brought up senator Wilson. he is wealthy and good friends with lipps. Wilson probably won't champion this issue because he is so overwhelmed. But would probably help draft. lipps said we should use his name, since Wilson would not turn away a friend of a friend. Lipps also thinks there is no chance we will get leadership to help draft or sponsor. ",1 - Supportive,OH

He started off by saying he would not be the right person to sponsor because he did not think this would play well in his district. H e said that the people on campus at OU are very liberal but they don't reflect the views of the rest of the district.He does not like Citizens United. He believes that corporations are not people and should not be treated as people in two ways. They should not be given the rights and protections of personhood and should not be taxed the same.He said he does not always support his party's position on the issues, he is there to support his constituents.He mentioned that he had won in the most difficult district for a Republican to win , so I asked him about the outside money that came into the election. He alluded to the voter-donor rule and told us about the donations his opponent received from the Democratic party. Edwards asked us about our political views, assuming that we were both Republicans. We hesitated before each explaining in our own way that we are reluctant to identify with either party and lean toward being independent. We both disclosed that we are registered as Democrats, and Edwards was genuinely surprised. He then asked us what issues we care about. Martin explained why he thinks healthcare is our top priority, and Alexis mentioned food deserts and inordinate crop subsidies. Edwards said he knew all about the issue of food deserts and expressed passion about the agribusiness issues in his district. He mentioned Vinton county as being the most food desert-riddled county in OH. He said that the only place to buy food there was the gas station convenience store, but he was able to help them get a grocery store where they could get fresh fruits and vegetables and he seemed proud of that as he should be.
Edwards said he would have to learn more about this before he could say if he could support it because he likes to thoroughly understand an issue before decides how to vote on it. He told us to check with Hagan, Wiggins. Scottt Ryan, Vitale, and Goodman. I think he would be more open to supporting this if his constituents were calling his office about it.",2 - Not Confirmed,OH

Rick Perales,Martin Keeley,11/9/2017,Met Legislator,"Martin and Ted met with Rep Perales. The meeting started off very well, with Martin and Perales talking about Martin's daughter who is stationed at the same military base that Perales oversaw when he was in the service. Perales believes money is speech, but did not agree with Citizen's United. When he asked us how do we solve this problem, I told him we don't have a set out;line of what we would like to see in an amendment, but I think anyone who has thought about this problem has some ideas on what they think would solve it. We want a convention called to discuss all of these ideas so we can come up with a consensus on how to move forward with an amendment.He was skeptical of the convention meant only to have a national conversation, and that we aren't proposing a solution. A potential solution to this is for volunteers to more fully understand mechanisms for resolving the issue of money in politics, eg more transparency in campaign finance, a cap on donations and spending, publicly financed elections, tax credits to constituents for giving money to candidates, the voter-doner rule, etc. These would need to be tailored for whichever political party a volunteer happens to be talking to. Perales agrees that money in politics is a problem, but it is a big undertaking to try and fix. He is willing to help with our efforts, eg investigatory, and wants to know more about our solution to solve the problem, so he would like to attend a meeting, or meet-up if possible. Unfortunately, because he is a veteran and state rep. he has events in his district he must attend on our next meet up on veterans day. 

Perales made it clear he thinks and he thinks everyone else gets the influence of money is a problem, stating ""who doesn't!?"". Perales went on to talk about his other positions, such as being against Medicaid expansion because the money goes to hospital CEOs who make millions of dollars. When we brought up that rep Dever was drafting our official language, Perales said that if the language made sense to him ""Hell I might carry it"". Going on to say he was a vet and the reason he is so successful is because he knows what he doesn't know, and is willing to listen to those who do know more than he does. Which is why he is willing to attend our meet-ups. He recommends talking to Sen. Hackett, relating our issue to an issue he is interested in, insurance, as well as talking to Sen. Beagle. This is because they are reasonable legislators who are in politics for the right reasons, and told us we can use his name when speaking to them. 

Perales recommended when we talk to more legislators to get more support, we should start off easy and work on educating them on the issue. However, we might come across reps who are influenced by money, citing how when reps become chair of a committee they start to get donations from organizations dealing with that issue. Perales said money doesn't matter to him, he used to make 200 thousand at his last job, he is a rep to make a difference. Then he told us about his recent legislation dealing with counterfeiting. He gets a call from the secret service who want his help getting legislation passed to track counterfeiting in his district, since most of the counterfeit money is going towards opioids. Also, he mentioned he doesn't agree with issue 2, a common theme among republicans, something to keep in mind for future meetings. At the end of the meeting, he asked us to get the LSC draft to him as soon as we get it as well as a summary of the opposition he should anticipate ",2 - Not Confirmed,OH

Wesley Goodman,Martin Keeley,11/14/2017,Met Legislator,"Ted and I met with Representative Goodman at his Columbus office. 
Rep Goodman started off our meeting by saying he understood the appeal of our resolution since he has to raise money to win elections. He is also very concerned about the federal government getting involved with too much which would create so many seats at the table for moneyed interests to influence our lives. Which they can do if they influence elections. While he agrees money is a problem, he thinks it is a symptom, and that we should reduce the size of the government to solve the problem. He also agrees that corporations get trillions of dollars in tax cuts when they donate millions to political campaigns. 

Goodman went on to say he can't be a primary sponsor because he's too busy, but he will revisit cosponsorship when we get a sponsor. Goodman thinks that on the state level that it is rare to get a lot of outside spending unless it is a highly contested area. But he agrees that there is more money at the federal level. He used the example of how state legislators can take $12,500 from an individual but federal candidates can only take $2,000. So he thinks that we should increase the amount individuals can give to reduce the influence of outside money and help people compete. He agrees with our idea to give a tax rebate to someone when they donate, and likes that we are already doing that in ohio on the state level. Goodman thinks the main thing we want to do is increase involvement of the voters, and agreed that this tax rebate program could possibly get more people engaged.

Goodman agrees with us when we said that people from California and new York should not influence elections in ohio for their own gain. Goodman also though that most if not all of the money used to promote or attack issues 1 and 2 was from out of state. 

When asked, Goodman said his main issues are Medicaid. It was not intended to cover a quarter of the state like it does, and so it needs to be modernized and reformed. He is also very concerned with campus free speech. And he mentioned that he was sponsoring a bill addressing a concern of a constituent and that he has and will do that often, but did not mention what it was. 

Goodman says that while there is no money going into campus free speech, hospitals are spending money to defend Medicaid expansion. When we asked him about big pharma influencing the opioid epidemic, he said he doesn't know if the pharma money has contributed. He says he personally doesn't ask for PAC money, sometimes it just shows up. But he says he does not think he is influenced by money. He has had donors pulling their contributions in retaliation for a position he will not change. And he will not ask his donors what to do when confronted with a new issue. He is more afraid of his constituents than of the media or donors. Finally, he closed the meeting by saying he wants to see the draft when it comes out of LSC, and he will revisit the issue then.

He said Dan Ramos would be into it, but he is frustrating to republicans and he wouldn't be successful with this. He didn't have anything to say about Tavia Galonski. Said joint sponsorship with a republican and a democrat is the best bet, he doesn't think a democrat sponsoring alone would be successful. Stressed that preparing the resolution to be favorable to leadership is necessary before getting introduced and sent to committee (they hate working on changes in committee, it should all be worked out prior). He starts working on a bill ahead of time with the intention of success in the following session. He said second year of a session (2018) campaigning takes up most of May-November and little gets done. His campaigns cost/raise $515,000, and the party caucus manages how the money is distributed. He said he likes campaigning (he has knocked on 29,920 doors in his district), he seems to genuinely care about constituents, he does not like needing to raise money. Said about 1200 bills/resolutions introduced each session, 200 some are voted on. Legislative aides rarely stay aides more than 5 years, and the best don't stay because there are higher paying jobs that pick them up. So, aides are not around long enough, and not enough of them to do all the needed research on bills, therefore he has to rely on lobbyists and industry leaders for a lot of his information. Still, he is known to be more closely connected to his constituents than most.",1 - Supportive,OH

They were under the assumption that larose had met with members of wolf pac fairly recently, however our records say that we have not had contact with him or his staff for a year. Then, they did not think it appropriate for anyone other than constituents to try to talk to the senator. Additionally, the staff cited ALEC as a credible source of information in regards to article V conventions. ALEC being one of the organizations giving money to reps and corrupting our democracy. Unfortunately, they also said ALEC was donating money to Senator Larose. In addition, in previous meetings with us, one of the biggest problems they had with our cause was that an article V convention had technically never been done before, so there are a lot of uncertainties involved with it. Thought that any more meetings with us would yield nothing new, and we would just say the same things over again. So there was no point in setting up any meetings.

My name is Christopher Michael Sikon and I am contacting you on behalf of the free Men and Women of Ohio. We are currently working very hard towards restoring free and fair elections within our Republic and feel as though decisions from our federal government are destroying our representative democracy. We feel as though we need common-sense solutions that allow great people with great ideas to represent and protect our constitution. When people feel that they are no longer represented, that our voice and our vote no longer mattes, we lose faith in our system of self government and stop participating. With your help, personally, we can restore our Republic and ensure that our representatives are free from the chains of dialing for dollars every day and can actually accomplish the job they we specifically sent to accomplish. Doesn't that sound truly great? With your help we can restore faith in our representative democracy. There are many issues that we all care very deeply about, from education to our economy, but none of these can be affectively addressed until we strike at the very root of these symptoms of an ailing representative democracy. We the People cannot wait any longer Ma'am. I am very much looking forward to speaking and working with you. We will all see each other to victory and I will be calling y'all within the next few days to speak personally about these issues.

Most Respectfully,

C. Michael Sikon""

She said Hite's schedule was full for the foreseeable future b/c of budget bill deliberation. She said Hite would contact me if something opens up. If not, she will contact me in May to set up a meeting/call. -- Side note I don't like the idea of the Rep. calling me ""if something opens up."" I'd rather have more notice. ",N/A,OH

Hite ,Derek Corea,4/2/2017,Phone call with Legislator,"Hite believes the federal election process has problems. Specifically, he believes out side interests and camping financing is one of them. He does not believe an article 5 convention is the way to fix our election process because the amount of national agreement required to pass such an amendment is unlikely. Therefore, spending time persuading others that an article 5 convention is necessary to change the constitution to make elections fair is a waste of his time because there are other, more immediate issues, he must address (LOL like amending the constitution to require each state to have a balanced budget). 

At the end of the day I cannot discern whether Hite has a reason to oppose our amendment (its a waste of time, unlikely), or simply opposes it because its the general republican position to do so. I found that Hite isn't very knowledgeable as to the intricacies of passing legislation and to what extent campaign financing truly impacts our election process. - This gives me hope that he can be convinced. Going forward, the goal is to convince Hite that money in politics its an issue worth his time. ",3 - Unsupportive,OH

He said he receives a variety of people's concerns on campaign finance and corruption, and commented that our discussion was more productive than most. We discussed how the people's impression is important, but he elegantly explained reasons why campaign donations don't affect his actions. He takes a lawyerly neutral stance, but he did bring up how super-pacs hide donation origins, and agreed that the influence of money is not ideal. More open to admitting Congress has a corruption problem while he maintained that his own actions aren't corrupt (probably accurate). He expressed concern about a convention departing from its intention, so I mentioned the DOJ report and its conclusion. We gave him the a resolution draft and he requested a link to the DOJ report to his direct email. He asked if he could be put on our ""email list"" but I said we don't really have updates or announcements that we send out via email.

Frank LaRose,Justin Fiorille,4/15/2017,Met Legislator,"This was a public hours meeting that Brannan Brouse and Justin Fiorille attended to meet LaRose. Brannan was already familiar with him and has discussed our resolution various times. This meeting was brief, but he definitely agrees that the campaign finance system needs reform, though initially he says money shouldn't be limited but it should be completely transparent, both donations and how money is spent by campaigns, but he did not disagree with our agenda so far. He is pro-Article V. He said he is running for Ohio Secretary of State in 2018, so he would have to consider how sponsoring a resolution like ours would impact that. I told him that Senator Jordan likes the resolution but wants more support from other republican senators, so LaRose said he would talk with Jordan. He said to give him 30 days to look into this and then we can discuss further. Note: This meeting went very positively, while Ted's previous meeting with staff did not. Brannan mentioned in passing that his staff has been difficult.

3) Dosn't support our resolution b/c 1) believes our resolution leads to public footing the cost of elections. 2) The problem isn't ""all money"" in politics/campaign contributions, rather the problem lies w/ those who give large amounts. (Pushed back1: our resolution doesn't dictate solution. His response: no way to have fair elections w/o public footing bill. Pushback2: Where's the line between ""no problem"" contribution and ""problem"" contribution. Response: No bright line rule, he personally finds a $10 donation from Bob down the street more influential than thousands of dollars from ""Exxon mobile."" (hmmm wonder why he said Exxon mobile)
4) Believes strengthening disclose requirements and promoting public awareness more realistic solutions to our issue. 
5) Going Forward - a) Research: how public is already footing bill under current campaign financing system. b) Question: Can small dollar contributes be acceptable -> Show generally money in politics is bad, specifically money in federal elections is bad.

I shared that I am calling also because of my concern about money in politics, and how it's affecting all issues, including education, and the corrupting influence it has on our politicians who are more beholden to corporations than those they're tasked to represent.

Kenny Yuko,Bob Richardson,9/18/2017,Met Legislator,"I met Senator Yuko at his home office this afternoon. We made small talk about the process of going from an ""actual office"" to a home office. Later, we transitioned to conversation about education, and I used this as an in, as we went back and forth talking about my schools I work at, to the problem of charter schools, to Betsy DeVos, to money in politics and how that's the only way someone like her could get appointed or even considered for the position of Secretary of Education. I used this as a spring board to talk about our proposal to amend the Constitution through an Article V Convention. He kept taking the conversation away from this focus and talked about other related issues, such as the state of Ohio with Republican donations, the absurdity in the Statehouse regarding how speakers are treated, etc. I had a hard time keeping him on the topic of the Article V convention and the resolution we're trying to pass. For every argument I made for it, he talked about either a) concerns regarding the actual process (i.e. does our resolution propose what we intend to), b) that Republicans will never go for it because they benefit from corporate donations, and c) that he's so incredibly busy and has to be careful of what he supports and how he spends his time because he's the Senate Minority Leader. I combated these concerns by affirming that we have been clear and consistent for the years we've worked on this across the nation that it's a limited convention and not a ""Constitutional Convention,"" which he repeatedly referred to it as. I also stated that the political pendulum will swing and Republicans are also concerned about the money Democrats receive. He laughed and said, ""We used to have labor unions, and now we're losing them--WHO'S donating to us?!"" I referenced the most recent election and how big banks make donations to campaigns for one, and he didn't have a rebuttal for that. Regarding his third point, I stated that all issues are clouded by the role of money in our politics, and no issue is more important than the corrupting influence of money because of that reason alone--if we are to combat climate change or support sensible gun regulations, we need to get money out of politics. He asked to see our resolution, as I had mentioned I brought it. He read through it and said he found something that would get it thrown out. He referenced a part that talked about ""amendmentS,"" not amendment singular. Specifically, this was the sixth ""whereas"" down, talking about ""proposing amendments."" Senator Yuko said that this would get it thrown out because it's antithetical to what we're proposing, which is a limited convention on one issue, and that this is inconsistent. I noted the concern and stated that this is just a draft of what we're proposing and that of course the legislators would draft the official language, which he conceded.

I pointedly asked if this was something he could support if it hit the floor. He paused, stared at me for about five seconds, and said, ""I would have to see the language first before I decide anything."" I asked if he is in support of the method and intent, and he said yes. I asked if he would sponsor it, and that was when he started talking about having to think about the whole party and his staff and being careful with what he sponsors. He strikes me as a cautious legislator who's seen a lot and wants to be certain of what he supports before agreeing to anything. As he walked me out to my car, he said off-handedly as he shook my hand, ""I'm known for getting the impossible done."" I'm not sure why he told me that and I'm not sure how much to read into it.

I wasn't sure if I should put him as a 1, because he seems to support what we're doing, but was in no way emphatic about his support. Just very cautious. I think we can definitely win him over with time. He did ask to keep the draft of the resolution and was open to meeting with us at CAD if he's in Columbus that day. I will call his office tomorrow to schedule something with his staff.

She will call back later today or tomorrow.

She asked some other interesting questions, really probing about us. I have gotten the feeling that it is okay to divulge some information in favor of being transparent rather than guarded, so I offered some insight. She asked how much support we were getting from other legislators. I told her we have good support from across the aisle and within the Democratic party, including from leadership. I mentioned Bob Peterson and Tavares. She seemed happy/surprised to hear this as she took notes. I also mentioned we had support in the House. She asked if many were opposed or in favor, and I told her we had a lot of people who were on the fence or said they agreed with what we were fighting for, but didn't want to comment just yet. She specifically asked about Sen. Skindell, because he is a ""very intelligent lawyer"" who is trying to pass a bill to alter how judges are appointed in relation to donations. I mentioned this sounded like someone who would be on board, and that I'd review the notes. I mentioned to her we had one contact with him in March, but weren't able to discern where he actually stood, and that we should probably reach out to him again to see if there were any updates, as he sounded like he could be a strong ally, and she said that he could be someone important to reach out to.

John Eklund,Anthony Coble,9/26/2017,Met Legislator,"Anthony and Justin meeting at CAD. We had a very polite conversation. Senator Eklund feels that the problem is really individual legislators not listening to their constituents. The real problem is people don't feel like they have a say in the process and legislators need to meet with and discuss issues with constituents so they understand why the legislator does what they do and feel like they have had their input in the process. We all agreed that local and state politics are less of an issue, and people feel mostly disenfranchised with the federal level.

He firmly opposes the cause, seeing it at worst as a necessary evil but not much of an issue. Said he would not sponsor or co-sponsor. He didn't say how he would vote on the floor, but we suspect ""no"".

I asked him his take on the reporting that federal legislators are expected to spend 30 hours a week calling donors. After a long pause he conceded ""that is unfortunate"".

Totally fine with the article V process.

Mentioned that if someone gives him $10,000 he will stay in contact with that person, but if he received $25 he would assume he would never see them again. He would gladly meet with the $25 dollar contributor just as he would any of his constituents.

Told us a story of an acquaintance that was very angry at Kasich. This person had given a large donation to Kasich, but could not get a meeting with him.",3 - Unsupportive,OH
John Barnes,Justin Fiorille,9/26/2017,Met Legislator,"Anthony and Justin meeting at CAD. He had the same outlook as the notes from Bob's recent phone calls. He agrees that money in politics is a problem and that it needs fixed, but he himself is not going to sponsor because he focuses on more immediate issues like local jobs. Further he would not co-sponsor because he is concerned that the language may change before going to a floor vote and he doesn't want to keep up with the changes. He would not draft the language with LSC either. He suggests we focus not only on long term goals (the amendment) but short term goals that are more achievable. He had concerns that a convention would change the rules of the convention, during the convention, but we got a little stuck in uncertainty when we asked if he thinks that would detrimentally affect the outcome. We then brought up the DOJ Report, and he seemed interested and requested a copy sent to him (will send soon).

The meeting went very well, Coley said he would vote in favor of our resolution when it came to the floor. Coley reiterated the points he had made before, that he thinks that spending money is speech and that Citizens United is good because unions and corporations can have their voice be heard in the political process. But only domestically. As a cosponsor of the balanced budget convention call he knows the convention can be limited, and said that we probably won't need the convention because congress, like in the 1980's, will pass legislation, like gramm-rudman, or an amendment when we get close. He went on to discuss how he is trying to convince the 24 republicans in the senate to vote be in favor of article V, using the arguments, ""what good is it to have the right to have a gun if you never pull it out of the holster even if someone is attacking your family."" and "" Article V is to have a discussion"" and ""we don't get to 38 states without some agreement"". One argument he heard from a fellow republican was that we did not send our best to the 1787 convention, therefore an article V convention is not a legitimate process. Coley thinks the democrats will only come on to the BB if they can be heard on the issue of campaign finance reform. He recommended we talk to senator skindell to draft the language, and later that day stopped us in the hallway to tell us he put in a good word for us with skindell himself. He went on to discuss how our group and him are similar in that we are fighting a difficult fight, as he usually takes on controversial bills and resolutions. However, he is sponsoring a fuzzy puppy bill to allow dogs on restaurant patios. Overall, a good meeting to build relations with him.",1 - Supportive,OH
Peggy Lehner,"Alexis A, Ted G, Garrett B",9/26/2017,Met with staff,"CAD: Alexis, Garrett, and Ted met with Senator Lehner's aide Kate. Senator Lehner greeted us as she was leaving the office. In the meeting, Kate said that Lehner is more hesitant that a convention will runaway, because their office keeps hearing concerns that an article V convention is like a runaway train. Kate asked us why a convention could not run away and what we thought of Huffman's BB resolution. We responded that Huffman's resolution is very broad and is the closest thing to an open convention as we would ever see, so we do not support the subject but we do support the method. Kate agreed, and said Lehner did too. We went on to discuss the ways limits on the convention can be imposed, eg recalling delegates, 38 states need to ratify, etc. Kate went on to say she found it heartening hear that we had faith in the american people. When we asked why Kate why Lehner cosponsored the BB resolution 2 years ago, but not the latest BB from Huffman, Kate explained 2 years ago it was more focused. so it seems clear Lehner is in favor of the article V method., but is sensible about it. when asked about Lehner's position about campaign finance reform, Kate stated that she has only worked for Lehner for a year and that it is illegal to discuss campaign finance in the office, so she had no idea. However, it is only illegal to discuss the candidate's campaign in office, not the financing.",2 - Not Confirmed,OH

Edna Brown,Martin Keeley,10/3/2017,Met Legislator,"Upon seeing our resolution and having our goals explained to her, Senator Brown said ""it looks like something that should have happened a long time ago"" and ""campaign finance needs some serious overhaul"". Brown's aide made the connection between our resolution and the COS resolution. But it became clear to Brown very quickly that, as she says, ""it seems that while the avenue to get the change is the same, the end result might be different"". Going on to say that she and her office will need to compare the two resolutions. (Brown voted in favor of the BB call two years ago, so on some level she thinks an Article V convention can be limited) Brown's aid also brought up the runaway convention concern and I gave the Senator a copy of the DOJ report and addressed that concern with her and her aid. I think it is a bigger concern to the aid than the Senator.
Like many democrats, Brown noted that realistically to have a real shot at getting passed we needed to talk to members of the majority party and get their support. Only when we get a sponsor, will brown ""take a hard look at cosponsoring"". She also noted that it is best to have as many cosponsors as possible and that we will definitely get some more democrats on board when we get introduced with a republican sponsor. We ended the meeting stating that the convention is just to have a conversation about campaign finance reform and acknowledge that it is a problem, then we can work toward solving the problem together. She agreed entirely, saying ""the most important thing is to get the conversation started"". I would say it is safe to put Senator Brown down as ""Supportive"".

Bob Hackett,Martin Keeley,10/3/2017,Met Legislator,"Met with Senator Hackett today and after explaining what we are trying to do he started on what they have tried to do at the state level concerning campaign finance and continued on non stop going from one issue to anther It was very hard to get a word in to get him back on topic. Hackett agrees that outside money is bad sometimes, but believes that realistically you might have to rely on it to get reelected. Says money does't influence him, and he has to raise 125,000 every year, only spending 2,000 a year on himself, the rest goes to other republicans. But, if we did get publically funded elections, how would we pay for it? He asked. To this we responded that we don't specify how we are going to solve the problem, just that we want to have a national conversation to acknowledge it is a problem and then we can work together to solve it. He thinks districts and term limits are the problem. He said we need to get the leadership to support us if we want to get the the rank and file members to support this. we told him that senators Coley, Larose, Tavares, Petterson, Sykes, OBrien, and Terhar are all supportive. He then asked if we had a sponsor and I said we are still working on that. I told him that in the house Representative Devers is working on drafting the final wording that will be introduced. He said that Devers is a good friend that he had worked with in the House so that could be useful for us. He said he could maybe support once we get the leadership on board and have a sponsor.

He thinks the balanced budget has a more likely chance, and then after that Ohio won't want to tackle a second ArtV. He flat out asked what our res has to offer that the BB doesn't. I explained that ours is a more focused call, and he thinks once at a convention the focus can go away and delegates will discuss anything (I think he actually would like the BB convention to be as open as possible), so I explained DOJ report briefly and gave him the summary. Then I explained that passing our amendment would make it easier the actually balance the federal budget, for example not giving large subsidies to entities that lobby for them but don't need them.

He does think that there is a big problem with the way campaigns are funded, he is against the Citizens United ruling saying that it just made things worse, and he said super-PACs are atrocities. He specifically said he doesn't like the corporate money influence, but small donations from citizens should be protected. He is mostly in favor of the Article V process and does not seem to have the usual runaway concerns with it. However, he wants the delegates to be no politicians at all, not just ban federal politicians. He said that the state legislature shouldn't even pick them, it should be regular citizens chosen by citizens, because he doesn't want politician delegates to be usurped by political influence. He certainly doesn't agree with publicly financed elections, so I said we don't dictate the outcome, but there are alternatives to public financing possible, such as voter/donor rule, tax credits giving people choice whether to finance or not, etc. We agree transparency has to be a part of it.

November 27, 2016

RE: Free & Fair Elections Joint Memorial


Dear Representative Marsh,

I am a voting constituent in your district and I’m very concerned about how corporate
financial donations distort our electoral process. I believe that the rise of the Big Money
drowns out the voices of America’s citizens, and thus, cripples our democratic process.

Although we may all come from varying political backgrounds, I believe we can come
together to change our nation’s political process for the better. On September 28, 2015, in a Bloomberg Politics national poll, 78 percent of those responding said the Citizens United Supreme Court ruling should be overturned compared with 17 percent who called it a good decision. 1 Unhappiness with the 2010 decision cuts across demographic and partisan and ideological lines. 1 This clearly shows support for a change in our campaign finance system.

America is founded on self-government, where citizens choose our elected representative, write our laws and decide the direction of our nation. America is founded on freedom. Freedom from corrupting influences in government is an American value.

In this democracy, we have two ways to solve this corrupting problem: one method is to work through Congress, and the other method is to work through the States to call for a Constitutional Amendment. As Congress in is debt to Big Money, I’m much more confident that we can effect change by working with State Legislators, like you.

I’m asking you to please support and co-sponsor the Free & Fair Elections Joint Memorial when it comes before you in the next legislative session.

Respectfully,




Laurie Kurutz

Susan McLain,Jo6,12/15/2016,Phone call with Legislator,"Call instead of face to face due to inclement weather. Rep.McLain appreciates our mission and goals, but thinks this needs to be worked on at the national and state levels, parallel paths that will change the election process. She said that there are barriers to long-term goals, opportunities for failure, and in setting priorities most of her energies and political capital this term will be spent on shorter-term improvements. I explained that only an actual amendment to the Constitution will fix the problem for the long run and that first requires a conversation, an Article V convention, about how to improve the system for average Americans. She said she wants to be part of that conversation. Without going into detail she said a Wolf-PAC representative acted rudely to a colleague last year, that that kind of attitude does not help our cause and she appreciated my approach and comportment. I told her this was the first I'd heard of any inappropriate behavior from a Wolf-PAC volunteer and that I would pass the information on to the director. She's hesitant to sign the bill and asked who the primary sponsor was. When I said Sen. Monroe she said she's known and worked with him for years and will talk with him and get caught up on the bill.

Other Intel:

Rep Greenlick does not sign on to Joint Memorials because he believes making those requests is pointless. Lively left the door open a little because this one is a constitutional demand and doesn't just go into the round file.

Rep Lively believes we used the wrong strategy with Kotek in the 2016 session. He says protesting outside her office probably hardened her against us; she historically reacts poorly to having things ""crammed down her throat"".

Hi Loren,

Thanks for your time today. Here is a link to the overview of SJM 2. The only change made in language from last year is we added Rhode Island.

https://olis.leg.state.or.us/liz/2017R1/Measures/Overview/SJM2

Rhode Island is another state that has passed our resolution calling an Article V Convention for the specific issue of Campaign Finance Reform.

This brings the total number of states that have passed our resolution to five.

We would like to schedule a meeting with Representative McLane and or staff to discuss any concerns and seek support and confirm a position, if possible.

Thanks again for your time,

Dear Marina,

Thank you for reaching out to me about the issue of campaign finance reform – I enjoyed meeting you when I came to your door last year. As someone who was outspent by about 50% in both of my elections last year, I’m all too familiar with the impact that money can have on the political process and the importance of limiting its influence. I fully believe that corporations are not people and money is not speech, and I strongly oppose Citizens United. Corporate personhood and unlimited spending by secret entities in election campaigns are two issues that the framers of our constitution never foresaw and certainly did not intend to become fixtures of our democracy.

I appreciate hearing your thoughts about a federal constitutional convention as a possible way to address the influence of money in politics at the national level. Although the US Constitution empowers states to call for a federal constitutional convention, none has ever taken place in our nation’s history. I do have some concerns about the ability to control such a convention once convened, especially in the current national political climate (see this article from a think tank focused on reducing poverty and inequality http://www.cbpp.org/research/states-likely-could-not-control-constitutional-convention-on-balanced-budget-amendment-or). But I’m open to learning more about the idea. In the upcoming legislative session, there are likely to be several proposals not unlike the one which you support. If I have the opportunity to vote on them, I will certainly take into account your point of view.

Thanks again for reaching out, and please stay in touch (on this issue or any others). I always appreciate hearing from my constituents, and I encourage you to keep in contact with me so that I can best represent you in Salem.

Best regards,

Julie Fahey, State Representative

Smith Warner,Lisa Sobomehin ,2/16/2017,Met with staff,"Jo Six and I met with Chloe, who had been in our previous meeting, along with two interns, one named Zoe who had been in email contact with me. I apologized for not getting back to her about her previous questions and then addressed them. Smith Warner had asked about other organizations, and Chloe brought that up again. Shared how Move to Amend and Wolf Pac had worked together to create the current legislation that had been introduced into the house last year and that now MtA was focused on education of the public. Chloe asked about Common Cause, and I clarified that they were focused on getting the federal legislators to pass an amendment so that was the legislation they had presented to Oregon legislators - to ask Congress to do it. We discussed that Common Cause is not behind an Article V convention. I told them that due to the Senators concerns I had spent extensive time and energy reviewing all the concerns and had come to a conclusion that the safeguards were numerous and real and that nothing totally off the purpose would happen and be successful. We revisited that the DOJ had concluded this and they had done so that last time that an issue was close to the ""magic number"" for calling the convention. One of the interns asked who paid for the convention. ... so that stands as an unanswered question. I shared what Cyenk stated in a video that we - the grass roots - would be the force that would keep the process from being bought or taken over. Repeated that this administration had woken too many people up and that now is the time to do this VERY important work. The mood of the meeting was reserved and guarded on the part of staff. They said they would be waiting and watching. ",2 - Not Confirmed,OR

Griffin and I met with Rayfield himself. He was immediately familiar with Wolf PAC and said he'd vote yes after we told him it was the same bill from last year. He talked some more about stuff he was doing to reform our election system, even gave us some copies of bills introduced in the house relating to it. During the conversation, he brought up that he was arguably the most committed to campaign finance reform at the capitol (something along those lines). We asked him to cosponsor and he said yes! We didn't have the billback (the thing he could sign) but we heard from Sen. Monroe's office that Rayfield could sign electronically.

Told them we were encouraged by the growing support we were seeing, including Sen Monnes Anderson in leadership. Retold the RI story of 100% support and applause for the citizens and how that demonstrated that others have overcome the concerns and have arrived at enthusiastic support.

Bill Kennemer,Brandon Gigous & Jo,2/23/2017,Met Legislator,"Gist: Wary at first, but started to warm up to our bill. Will think about it.

We went into the meeting knowing (at the last minute from his website) that Rep Kennemer is an advocate for campaign finance reform. Told him what our bill was about and then asked his thoughts on campaign finance reform. He said he didn't like how someone could make a comment on a candidate and not be held responsible for saying that comment. We brought up that we can bring those points up at the convention, should it happen. Said that he is working with Rayfield on a bill regarding disclosure.

He didn't think a convention could be limited, but we pointed out the attorney general's report. He was worried about a runaway convention. We brought up that the convention would just mean having a conversation about campaign finance reform. We also said that a convention wouldn't ""run amok"" (as he put it) since 1) delegates will be state/local officials and 2) delegates must represent wishes of their state and can be pulled if they go off topic. Before we left, he said he would think about it. Jo gave her business card.",2 - Not Confirmed,OR

She will sign the bill when it gets to the House or before if other bills die since she doesn't want to look like she's supporting everything (which can look like they don't support anything). She was aware of Wolf-PAC from last year and we told her the 6M members and 220M views per month and encouraged her to watch the video of Wolf-PAC's Rhode Island victory. Talked about her family (she's 5th generation Oregonian - wagon trains people meet English immigrants from Canada).

Diego Hernandez,Chris Chaplin,2/24/2017,FaceTime Call with Legislator,"Rep. Hernandez was very mild-mannered and easy to talk to. He asked about our relationship with other groups pushing similar measures including Common Cause and Represent.Us. Said he initially confused us with the National Popular Vote bill which he voted for. I clarified that we are different from all of them and that several of the groups pushing similar measures are ally groups to us but that we don't coordinate with them. (He explained at the end of the call that Common Cause is pushing for campaign finance reform at the Oregon state level and said ""they have some pretty good stuff"" in their proposal citing returning power to individuals over large campaign donors; I noted that we cannot dictate the solution once it goes to a convention but that we are probably advocating for many of the same changes, just at the federal level.) After I explained that we are calling for an amendment to the US Constitution, and went through the argument we sometimes here about limited conventions, he said right away that he would sign on, but when he tried to do so he said was being blocked from electronically signing it, which he showed me on his computer screen. He said he and his staff would figure it out but that in any case when it comes up for a vote in the House he would definitely vote for it. He also showed me the OLIS system and how we can track the progress of SJM 2. Said ""thank you for the work you're doing"" and we signed off. Very positive, pleasant conversation.",1 - Supportive,OR

Paul Evans,Craig Pageau,9/14/2017,Met Legislator,"Showed up early to town hall meeting at Salem library and met with a number of the reps staff. Intros and light conversation then more detailed discussion with chief of staff Evan. Evan is also second banana with West Salem Neighborhood Association, which is heavily embroiled in the ugly 3rd bridge debate here in Salem. Only about 16 people at meeting, most all seem to be regular attenders. Rep. Evans immediately notices me when he enters and makes a point of introducing himself and shaking my hand. Everyone introduces themselves and says why they are here. Towards the end of the meeting Evans calls on me to speak recalling my remarks about free and fair elections during the intros. I explained to him and the other attendees our concerns about big money in politics and what we at WolfPAC are doing. He was particularly impressed with me saying we have little hope of Congress solving the problem and we have faith in state legislators to be more responsive to the people. After the meeting, shook his hand again and followed up on a remark he made about being a vodka drinker by asking him if he drinks Oregon distilled vodka.He smiled and said he drinks Hood River brand vodka. I told him if he needs to ""inspect"" some other brands, I was available for ""consultation"". He said make sure and leave my contact info to assist him in that research. Asked for a meeting with several of us at legislative days, he said absolutely, gave me the location of his office and said either just drop by or make an appointment with Evan. Talked to Evan on way out, he said he recalled my voicemail and email and would be contacting me today about meeting with Rep. Evans. The Rep. is an intelligent man well versed in the details on a wide variety of issues. He is cautious about not stepping on toes and puts a lot of value on navigating thru procedure. I suspect being so detail oriented may make it more difficult to get full throated endorsement from him. Best have someone wonky with me for the meeting, attention to detail and making him more comfortable with the process could pay dividends with Rep. Evans.

She took our chants in 2016 to be very offensive and disrespectful, particularly to Rep Gilliam. We need to apologize to Rep Gilliam, and Phil is spearheading that effort. We asked for Mr. Gilliam's contact info from the House Republican Office.",2 - Not Confirmed,OR
Rob Nosse,Brandon Gigous,9/18/2017,Met Legislator,"Dawn and Daniel joined in meeting. Rep Nosse said last year people started getting scared of a convention, even namedropped ACLU. Daniel tried addressing that concern (""bad taste in their mouth about conventions""), mentioning path to 17th Amendment. Couldn't introduce us as he already promised to introduce two bills last year on healthcare, but I asked if he could cosponsor and he said yes. Said we might be able to introduce in Rules Committee, where 3 bills can be introduced. Mentioned Rayfield, was curious what he would think. Will email him about how our meeting goes, as well as what CA and IL have passed. Will also mention that these states are mentioned in the legislation.",1 - Supportive,OR
Diego Hernandez,Brandon Gigous,9/18/2017,Met Legislator,"He is on board with campaign finance reform. He said he would cosponsor our bill, but can't introduce because it would ""fall on deaf ears"" (he doesn't have the influence on this particular issue). Said Rayfield would have to introduce it, but he'd sign on. He's more focused on housing issues, racial equality, things like that. Staffer Adriana(?) was also in the meeting.",1 - Supportive,OR
Piluso,Lisa Sobomehin & Paul M.,9/18/2017,Met Legislator,"Very good feeling about Wolf Pac . Finally remembered co-sponsoring, Very supportive and enthusiastic. No reservations about the method. Only real question was whether it was already written, and if it worked with the 'one vote' movement. Shared that could be discussed at convention.
She has 3 bills she is working on, but if any of them falls through she would definitely consider us. Will let us know in two weeks. Left her with the packet so she knew the bill was already drafted and what was in it. Shared that there are people who have been influenced by fear mongering but we are addressing that, so if it is introduced we will be able to overcome that. When we do we will help create a cascade of states ( this is Lisa's thoughts and I clarified that) Told her the answers to those concerns were in the other articles we left with her. Mentioned CC by name as the source of loss of momentum. Emphasized that we are leading with urgency because this effects our children and we can't keep delaying.. so we are on an ernest hunt for a herol 

We will be in touch within a couple of weeks. ",1 - Supportive,OR
Greg Barreto,Phil Guidotti,9/18/2017,Met Legislator,"Rep Barreto seemed to think we had changed from another issue to campaign finance reform. We continue to work against the misconception that we are just an Article V Convention group with multiple issues. We tried to clear this up, as we do with many meetings. But he's very friendly and willing to listen. He has ""both ears open and a closed mind"". Funny fella.",2 - Not Confirmed,OR
McKeown,Ezra,9/18/2017,Met Legislator,Rep McKeown was available and met with us immediately. She had questions related to the runaway convention. We reassured her that the language of the bill precluded that. We asked her about introducing the bill. She said that her 's were already. committed She also mentioned that introducing in the house is unlikely if we don't get Sen Courtney to agree to give it a hearing in the senate. She also complemented Wp for being tenacious. we are taking a packet to her now. ,1 - Supportive,OR
Barreto ,Craig Pageau,9/18/2017,Met Legislator,"Good listener, responsive to key words/phrases. Not concerned about apology for 2016 incident. Made point of identifying many small businesses as corporations. Pro-balanced budget , states rights , so no conflict with Article V process. Differentiated between public (bad) and private (not so bad) unions.",1 - Supportive,OR
Alyssa Keny-Guyer,,,Met Legislator,"Met with Rep Keny-Guyer and Rep Rayfield this afternoon. So much discussed. At first, we didn't talk any Wolf PAC. Instead, they talked about their state-level reforms like the 6:1 small donor matching solution, and the Portland-based public financing solution that was a bit of an experiment, missed getting voted in by 1,000 votes (very close!). Keny-Guyer was really disappointed that it didn't pass. She is commited to state level reforms. She was at first defensive about being opposed to our bill based on procedure concerns (runaway convention). She seemed to be ready for us to get on her case. But we were friendly to her of course. She said while the system the way it is, she will continue accepting contributions and use them for progressive candidate campaigns and other good reasons. Rayfield was totally fine with the convention process. He mentioned how impossible it is to pass anything with a 3/4 supermajority of states. The ratification step plays really well with him. Did I say he's a lawyer?

Anyway, Keny-Guyer gave me time to go through all the Amendment Convention stuff (1787 convention clarification, Con-Con versus limited amendment convention, basics about determination, proposal, and ratification stages, and finally my Fortress Frame about the four branches of government dealing with an amendment process: delegates of the convention, states, Congress, Supreme Court. I talked about how those branches all have checks on each other. At the end, after carefully listening to all of that, she said at one point when I presented my documents about the checks in the amendment convention process, she said- ""Oh yeah, the house"" Frames man, they work!

We need to follow up with more info for her and see how all of that info landed.",2 - Not Confirmed,OR
Dan Rayfield,Phil Guidotti,9/18/2017,Met Legislator,"Meeting with Keny-Guyer present. Most of the data is already entered in the Keny-Guyer entry. Dan is pro- amendment convention due to the ratification bar (3/4 states). He might introduce us in 2019, would sponsor in 2018. FYI, Rep Hernandez said he'd do what Rayfield does. Dan seems to be the House expert on campaign finance reform. He also said that Reps Power, Sanchez, Nosse were big on campaign finance reform.",1 - Supportive,OR
Paul Evans,Craig Pageau,9/18/2017,Met with staff,"Set up meeting with with Rep. Evans for 9/20 at 1130 at LD. Talked extensively with chief of staff Evan about Article V, history of several amendments and politics in general. He tried to make an argument that contributions from unions is ok, but not from corporations. He seemed to enjoy the conversation and said ""don't be a stranger"".Growing a strong relationship with this office. Probably supportive, but waiting for meeting to make determination.",2 - Not Confirmed,OR
David Brock Smith,Phil Guidotti,9/18/2017,Met Legislator,"Rep Brock Smith (Brock is his middle name, which stuck because he wants to be distinguished from others with similar names). He was very friendly, has history in the Rogue Valley, knew about Sams Valley. He worked in a Medford Shojis in 1996. Funny guy, good natured. His bills of choice this year include a working families solution to the housing crisis that drops the price of housing, and gives a tax credit to builders that participate. His other bill puts a mechanism after a bill has passed and its rules have been implemented, where the chief sponsors can approve or reject the final product after rules are defined.

As for our Wolf PAC legislation, he seems completely supportive. He said ""why isn't my name on this biil"" when presented with SJM 2. Enthusiastic supporter. He sounds 100% sure of sponsoring us if we get introduced in the short session.",1 - Supportive,OR
Piluso,Lisa Sobomehin,9/19/2017,Emailed legislator,"Emailed her to thank her for the meeting yesterday. Told her I was encouraged by her support for the Article V strategy for handling this issue.

Carl Wilson,Phil Guidotti,9/19/2017,Met Legislator,"Rep Wilson is very supportive, he already has a bill he's introducing in 2018 (hemp legislation), but his other bill is open. He said we should come back in November if we're unable to get anyone else to introduce us. He's going to listen to his constituents and see if anything comes up that he needs to support more. But he may introduce us...

General mood was very friendly. He asked why we didn't get any more push in 2017. We discussed the reticence legislators have regarding Article V Conventions, and the fear-based tactics out there that are unfortunately very effective. We talked about unions and he thought they are no different than unions in the campaign finance system. Good advocate, ended on very friendly terms. He remembered me well.",1 - Supportive,OR
Ken Helm,Eamon Driscoll,9/19/2017,Met Legislator,"Helm seemed very receptive of our apology, we also were able address the concerns of a runaway convention. He said he would vote with us and that he thinks there is a lot of others who would support. He also thanked us for volunteering and being involved.",1 - Supportive,OR
David Gomberg,Phil Guidotti,9/19/2017,Met Legislator,"Rep Gomberg was friendly with us, particularly with Shawn (constituent and friend of Eamon). They talked about the Depot Bay fishing scene and affordable housing. Then we talked about our bill. He mentioned his ""shareholders united"" bill that didn't pass, but it sounded solid (shareholders are required to declare how they spend contributions). Then he talked about the huge mistake of Citizens United. He's 100% on board with the policy. But he said ""Constitutional Convention"" a number of times, and mentioned every concern in the book (runaway, open convention, 1778 convention). We did our best but his ears were really that open. He is entrenched in his position of fear over the convention process, and so is his staffer Kyle.

We should shoot for a SE Portland meeting with Kyle, or during November Leg Days. We have to convince him that our resources are sound, and the the limited convention concern is answerable with evidence and sound legal research.",3 - Unsupportive,OR
Julie Fahey,Jacob Strandlien,9/19/2017,Met Legislator,"Eamon and Daniel attending. Julie was super duper informed and came with concerns to address. Limited convention is one of those concerns; we responded with the usual point. Partisan makeup of state legislators potentially resulting in a non-favorable amendment was another concern, and her third concern was a convention potentially resulting in an amendment relaxing rules on campaign finance rather than strengthening them. We responded by pointing out that the whereas clauses in the legislation that has passed so far specifically point out the problems that need to be addressed, and that nefarious national influences are reduced by our delegate selection process.",2 - Not Confirmed,OR
David Brock Smith,Mindy Lowden,9/18/2017,Met Legislator,"Phil, Steven and I met with Rep. Smith. Conversation started on a light note with Rep Smith sharing stories about his time as a cook at Shoji's. He's still very supportive of our bill, but when asked if he would introduce it in 2018, he said he already has two bills. One of them is a housing bill, about which he talked in great detail. The goal of the bill is to increase housing availability for working families by providing developers with a tax break. His second one is a rules bill where you must get approval of any changes to a bill from the sponsors before it can move forward. He recommended checking with Piluso and Wlson about introducing our legislation. I'm pretty sure he'll sign on as a sponsor if we get it introduced.. ",1 - Supportive,OR
John Huffamn,Phil Guidotti,9/19/2017,Met Legislator,"Rep Huffman is an honorable man. He was very candid in his conversation with me, some of which will remain in confidence. But I can share that he appreciated our apology, and gave us contacts in the House Speaker's office for who we can apologize to in order to start mending fences with her.

Also, Rep Huffman is up for an appointment and he may vacate his House seat at any moment.",1 - Supportive,OR
Keny-Guyer,Lisa Sobomehin,9/19/2017,Emailed legislator,"Alyssa had emailed me thanking me for the information I sent about my son. Replied saying glad our paths crossed again and maybe we could get together for tea or coffee sometime in district when her schedule settled down. 

Thanked her for the meeting. Said I was glad she had time with Phil to begin getting comforting answers to her concerns. Offered to send article and DOJ report if she didn't have them yet. ",,OR

John Lively,Mindy Lowden,9/19/2017,Met Legislator,"Phil, Jacob, and Mindy attended the meeting. Started off by apologizing for the 2016 chant. He seemed receptive to it. Stated he's for campaign finance reform and thinks it is important. He's worried about doing anything at a national level because of the chaotic nature of the current political climate. He's much more comfortable trying to make changes at the state level. He's talked with groups that oppose the article v convention process in his office. He doesn't know which side to believe. Already has his legislation designated for 2018.",2 - Not Confirmed,OR
Knute Buehler,Phil Guidotti,9/19/2017,Met with staff,"Met with Jordan Conger for 30 minutes, he was very engaging and friendly. He really knew his stuff. He likes the People's Pledge that is working in Massachusetts. Apparently Elizabeth Warren and others agree to not accept certain contributions as a private contract, and even agree to pay to charity twice what any independent contributor gives to their campaign. This effectively dissuades outside entities from paying into these elections.

We talked about the $200 tax credit idea from Taxation only with Representation, as well as the voter/donor rule and increased transparency as potential solutions that could come about in a convention. We mentioned how our bill can only provide a venue for a discussion on how to solve our campaign finance issues, and that any solution would have to be bipartisan enough to be ratified by 75% of the states. In the end, Jordan appreciated our efforts. He said the Representative didn't have his bills decided for the short session, and that he'd run it by him, but introducing us was unlikely. We talked about how the short session was really for small fixes, but he acknowledged that our bill has bipartisan support, is only a single page, and hasn't changed for a few years, and therefore could be a good candidate for the short session. He said to check back in if we don't get any other legislators to introduce... ",2 - Not Confirmed,OR
Paul Holvey,Phil Guidotti,9/20/2017,Met with staff,"Met with Cassidy of Rep Holvey's staff. She was a great listener, and she seems to be a dedicated environmental advocate. She listened to our points about the Article V Convention process, and how important this issue is. No concerns, just information gathering. They said Rep Holvey is focused on environmental bills for the short session, but they said to check back in if we do get introduced.",2 - Not Confirmed,OR
Paul Evans,Phil Guidotti,9/20/2017,Met Legislator,"Very productive meeting with Craig Pageau in attendance (constituent). He is supportive, and he'd sponsor us if we get certain champions on board. He really values getting an R and a D on board that would sponsor. He recommended Reps Lively, Mclain, and Barker for the Ds, and Vial, Noble, Huffman, and Senator Boquist for the R side. Keep this information confidential.

He also said that he wanted a mechanism for the Attorney General to be designated as the person to enforce convention limitations. It would be similar to the Electoral College Interstate Agreement, and he even said we need to research the 1964 and 1968 democratic party conventions as examples of what to avoid. We need to research this. He said that we should have a line in the bill that reads something like ""Oregon is authorized to establish an interstate agreement/compact for the Attorney General to enforce delegate restrictions to the topic selected in the convention call legislation"" We need to see about whether we could include this in our legislation. Will check with National.

Finally, Craig may have some opportunities (as well as would other constituents) to help with other work groups for either small business, community building, or veterans issues. Rep Evans is interested in engaging his constituents in these projects.",1 - Supportive,OR
Mark Johnson,Phil Guidotti,9/20/2017,Met Legislator,"Mark has no process or issue concerns, and he's ready to primary sponsor. He will consider whether to introduce us, but he has a number of competing priorities. If we can convince him somehow that we have a better shot of getting through committee, we might be able to sway him. But he seems like he'd like some space until November Leg Days, so tread lightly.",1 - Supportive,OR
Jennifer Williamson,Phil Guidotti,9/20/2017,Met with staff,"Craig and Phil apologized to staffer Jennifer who was around during the 2016 protests. She seemed hostile to us, and said that we did very damaging things that year. She seemed like she had barely-stifled angry towards us. She said that the Majority Leader's office stands with the Speaker, and therefore if we make it right with the Speaker, we'll make it right with the Majority Leader.",3 - Unsupportive,OR
Tina Kotek,Phil Guidotti,9/20/2017,Met with staff,"Craig and Phil apologized to Annette Rose at the front desk. She remembered the event of the protest vividly, and said there were only 2 times that she had to hit the panic and our protest in 2016 was one of them. She thinks our protest was far too aggressive. She felt very strong about how overt we were, but she was kind and appreciative of our apology. She recommended a written letter of apology to Speaker Kotek, which we must deliver. Greg Adelson and Tim Inman were not present, so we will need to consider apologizing to them as well.",3 - Unsupportive,OR
Jeff Barker,Brandon Gigous,9/20/2017,Met Legislator,"Darla joined in the meeting. We met Rep. Barker at Moonstruck Chocolate Cafe. We talked to him about the legislation again (he cosponsored in 2017) and asked if he could introduce. Although still supportive, he's concerned about whether the convention could actually be limited. I mentioned the fact that the Constitution can't be changed at the convention, that any proposal would still need 75% ratification and only the strongest proposals can survive. Can't introduce, but said he would cosponsor again.",1 - Supportive,OR
Paul Evans,Craig Pageau,9/21/2017,Emailed legislator,"Follow-up email thanking Evans and chief of staff for talking with me and Phil at LD 9/20. This relationship really took off, seems they were primed for our visit and they carried the ball to a large degree in the meeting. Gave us an interesting angle on advancing our legislation that Phil and national will review. Chief of staff Evan Sorce heavily involved in conversation, seems to have strategised with Evans before our meeting. Evans, a retired air force major, is now very straight up and candid with us. He approached me to become a volunteer member of his staff at the end of the meeting. We may have tapped into a rich vein here. ",1 - Supportive,OR
Tina Kotek,Craig Pageau,9/20/2017,Met with staff,"Accompanied Phil to the long planned apology to Speaker Kotek at her Capitol office. Talked to front desk staffer, Phil delivered the apology and asked what we could do to improve our relationship with the speaker. Staffer said to send a letter to a particular higher ranking Kotek staffer. She also mentioned how intimidated she felt during the 2016 WolfPAC protest outside the speakers office and said she kept her hand near the security alert button under her desk. Deep damage is obvious here, but staffer was cordial. For the rest of the story go to Rep. Jennifer Williamson, District 36.",3 - Unsupportive,OR
Jennifer Williamson,Craig Pageau,9/20/2017,Met with staff,"This is a continuation of the apology meeting with Speaker Kotek's staffer. As tough as the previous apology meeting was, this one was brutal. Met with front desk staffer for House Majority Leader Williamson. She recognized Phil before the introduction and wouldn't shake his hand. She stated right up front that she and the staff were completely loyal to the Speaker. Chucks of frozen air dropped to the floor from the glare she was giving Phil. Phil did his best to get through the apology, but it was obvious she wasn't being very receptive. I couldn't stand watching this Christians vs. lions display and broke in saying,"" I've only been with WolfPAC for 5 months , but me and WolfPAC know that we own this, but we are not defined by our failures. We are defined by our issue. We are prepared to do what's necessary to fix this."" Might have changed the tone a little or she just got tired of listening to us and has us writing another letter to somebody. Phil can really take a punch, but that was a merciless beating. Going to take a huge investment to fix this. ",3 - Unsupportive,OR

I told her I wanted to deliver an apology letter because we really wanted to let her know we were sorry for what was done and wanted to have clear air to work together on the future. She was warm and sincere and said she had no grudges against us. She would read the letter... but she would not be voting for an Amendment Convention, because there was a conservative cause that was only 3 states away and the process could not be controlled. I told her we were confident that it could and that we would welcome another conversation with her to explain why we were so confident. She said we could email and set up a meeting during legislative days. This was huge progress! The past is behind us and we get an open chance to face the 'real' issues. ",3 - Unsupportive,OR

Sollman,Lisa Sobomehin,11/8/2017,Met Legislator,"Rep Sollman met me in Insomnia Cafe.. the preferred in house meeting spot. She has only been in the House for one year. She felt like a clean slate. She had lots of good questions trying to truly understand the Article V Convention process. While describing it I sprinkled in safeguards. She looked over the bill and the sponsors and cosponsors and then asked why it hadn't already happened. Backing up, when I asked her if she knew anything about Wolf Pac, she beamed ""I know Jo!"" and told me how they had met while she was knocking on doors for her campaign, how they had clicked as fellow Bernie Sanders supporters. So she is very supportive of the need for federal level campaign finance reform, as well as local. I was able to feel comfortable enough with her level of support that I could be honest about the barriers we have faced, and the possible messages she may encounter as she met with past sponsors. She responded with our talking points often on her own, and certainly vibed with them when I gave them. She offered suggestions for how to counteract the fear about the process by suggesting we attend Wash Co, Mult Co and Clack Co Dem meetings and make presentations about the Article V process... anticipating that they would speak to their legislators about their newly found confidence in it's security. I mentioned Common Cause to her to forearm her to that reality before she met it. She put us on her short list - now 8 long and said we could get back to her on Nov 17th. ",1 - Supportive,OR
Mark Meek,Jacob Strandlien,11/13/2017,Met Legislator,"Mindy Lowden attending. Staffer Marcus attending. Extremely successful meeting. Meek started off by saying how interested he is in our cause. Did standard D elevator pitch and he said it's something he's willing to sign in to. He brought up the runaway concern, but suggested he didn't share that concern and he seemed very happy with our response. We asked about introduction, and he said he has an open slot and will consider us, but he has a couple of other priorities that he is focused on (housing, vet issues).

He and Marcus were both disappointed that Mark Nesser (PoC) couldn't make it to the meeting, and I'm sure Mark would have made an even greater impact. I would recommend finding a way to get Mark to a meeting with him in the future.",1 - Supportive,OR
Wilson,Lisa Sobomehin & Mindy Lowden,11/14/2017,Met Legislator,"Mindy and I met with Rep Wilson. He was friendly. Said he is still very supportive (as long as the bill hadn't changed) and will sponsor, but not as chief sponsor because he didn't have time to do what was necessary, press coverage, etc. When asked what could be done to move it forward either this year or in 2019 (which he thought was more likely) he said it was important to figure out why it hadn't gone forward before. He said leadership wouldn't let it go forward. Lisa shared with him that WP had delivered an apology letter to her and that she said she had no grudges, but that there were still barriers in her misconceptions and that we were following through on getting a meeting with her that she offered, either in Jan or Feb. He said the apology was good, even though he considered the actions as just politics. He said it was more important to have more Democrats as sponsors and cosponsors. The Republican support was important for bipartisanship, but not as important to leadership. He encouraged checking back with all past supporters to see if they are still supportive. He said the Democrats were more focused on Health Care, Housing and Cap & Trade in this session, although he didn't think that was appropriate for the short session. ",1 - Supportive,OR

Pam Marsh,Phil M Guidotti,1/7/2017,Met Legislator,"From Laurie Kurutz:

Pam's questions:
1. When was the last convention that produced an amendment?
2. How will it work with delegates at the convention? When discussions and questions come up during the convention, how would the delegates know what we want them to do? How would we communicate with them?

Pam came across as professional, circumspect and diplomatic in her communication. She folded into her comments a bi-partisan point of view that acknowledged what Wolfpac might consider ""the other side."" 

I noticed that she became a little impatient, or ""squirmy"" in her chair, when Lara turned the conversation to waving the flag for Bernie Sanders, denouncing the media and calling Trump a liar. I sensed that we shouldn't make assumptions about people's politics just because they're Democrats. Perhaps we, as a group, could discuss how to create a personal relationship with folks we're lobbying, while staying focused on Wolfpac's task. It's a tricky balance. 

I think that while Pam has Democratic values, she will be working very much in a bi-partisan way to move those values forward. She said she would ""look at"" our proposal. We said we would get the answers to her questions, and look forward to seeing her in Salem on Lobbying Days. ",,OR
Pam Marsh,Phil Guidotti,1/7/2017,Met Legislator,"Lara Scanlon's thoughts:

I think the meeting was a great success with Pam- her parting words were that we were very persuasive, and that she was very drawn to this cause, would read all the materials thoughtfully, and was interested in the answers to her questions and in seeing us during session.

Pam listened very thoughtfully and right from the start had very in depth and specific questions. She was very clear that she agreed that money influencing politics was an issue, but also brought up a very interesting issue that on the state level in OR, congress members had unbelievably small budgets to run their offices, which meant that many ended up using their campaign funds to supplement these funds in order have office spaces in their districts and pay their staff members. When I brought up the point that we have greater access to our state congress people that our federal congress members, she did take some issue with that, saying that it was not hard to get a meeting with Senators Wyden and Merkley (and indeed, I have sat in a room with both of them!)- and her assessment in part was that Oregon may be an unusual state in that regard, and that we are smaller and tighter knit than other states.

Pam was very interested in the bill and the idea of a convention leading the way to lasting chance in the way money plays a role in politics. Her greatest concern was the idea of a runaway convention (which we explained was not possible given the explicit language of the bill),

but her greater concern was the idea of ""opening up the Constitution in this political climate"" (these were her words).
It was in this context that I explained that what I found so interesting about this political climate was that in poll after poll 90 percent of Americans want money out of politics. Furthermore, I explained that what I found so positive was the fact that many Republicans wanted to vote for Bernie. I explained that over and over in southern OR, I experienced people coming up to me when I was wearing a Bernie shirt, and telling me that even though they were life long Republicans, they would to vote for Bernie over Trump (this was obviously before the primaries). 

Again, in this context of Pam specifically asking, and explaining that she was concerned about the possible outcome of a convention during this political climate, and the possibility of conservatives shaping this conversation in a way that would not bring the change we were hoping for- I explained that I thought a citizen led delegation during a convention is very hopeful given that Bernie was speaking an economic truth to the population that garnered incredible bi-partisan support. Those same people who ultimately voted for Trump, are many of the people who would gladly support free and fair elections, but I explained that many of them voted for Trump because he was being dishonest about his actual economic policies, how they will effect working people, and his ties to corporate money, which will influence his politics greatly.

At the start of the meeting Pam had said she needed to leave at around 2:50, though she continued to ask very in depth and complicated questions about both the bill, and the influence of money and media in politics. Though clearly Laurie had a different read, I do not think Pam was in any way uncomfortable with this in depth discussion, rather, I think she was checking her phone to see what time it was and recognizing that she needed to go, even though she was continuing to ask questions.

Overall, I think she is an incredibly thoughtful, intelligent, nuanced Representative. I really appreciated her take and explanation of how money in politics on a local level is necessary to a degree, though she was very clear that she was unwilling to ask for any money from corporations in whose mission she was not aligned with (she specifically mentioned the timber industry), but it is clear that congress people do need to raise a certain amount of money to be able to reach constituents.

Justin Brice, constituent, was going to attend the meeting. He called in instead and spoke to Rep Rayfield this morning to express how important this issue is to him, to thank him for his support of this legislation, and to urge his continued support for it. Started meeting with small talk about Albany/Corvallis Area and various topics. Foor example, he was curious how people in Albany find out about groups like Wolf PAC, He is still behind the bill and thinks the convention is something that needs to happen. He listed various campaign finance reform ideas (caps on expenditures, public financing/donor matching, etc.) I told him those are perfect examples of what could be discussed at a convention and that he'd be a great delegate. He talked about other election reform as going hand in had with campaign finance reform (rank choice voting, etc.). Campaign finance reform is something he's passionate about. He talked about Wolf PAC's past actions that have caused some legisltators to distance themselves from the group, but that the bigger hurdle is the fear of an article v convention with the current partisan climate, trump, etc. will lead to a ""runaway."" I got confirmation from him that he believes the safeguards are sufficient to ensure this would not happen (he thinks the ratification threshold alone is enough). He said he 2018 will probably not happen, but he's looking to 2019 to carry the bill. He said he's thinking it would/could be himself, Kenny Guyer, and Nosse. We talked about the support level we have from a number of reps. I mentioned specifically that Rep. Evans is a big supporter. I let him know about the additional clause that will probably be added to the language of the bill, but added that it's not set in stone/possible there may be slight change in the wording. He seemed fine with it and requested that a copy be emailed to Tony, his aide. Ended with him reaffirming his support for the article v process and it being an important part of the way we tackle the problem. We had a good conversation for sure. ",1 - Supportive,OR

Senator Alan DeBoer
PO Box 249
Ashland OR 97520

November 27, 2016

RE: Free & Fair Elections Resolution Joint Memorial

Dear Senator DeBoer,

I am a voting constituent in your district and I’m very concerned about how special interest money (ie. unions, out-of-state donations) distorts our electoral process. I believe these powerful entities drown out the voices of America’s citizens, and thus, cripple our democratic process.

Although we may all come from varying political backgrounds, I believe we can come together to change our nation’s political process for the better. In June of 2015, a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll showed the highest concern for voters was the excessive influence of money in the election process. People of all political leanings reported major concern for the way our elections are funded and run.1 This clearly shows support for a change in our campaign finance system.

America is founded on self-government, where citizens choose our elected representative, write our laws and decide the direction of our nation. America is founded on freedom. Freedom from corrupting influences in government is an American value.

In this democracy, we have two ways to solve this corrupting problem: one method is to work through Congress, and the other method is to work through the States to call for a Constitutional Amendment. As members in Congress are pressured to spend huge amounts of time and energy cold calling for election funds 2, I'm much more confident that we can effect change by working with my State Legislators, like you.

I’m asking you to please support and co-sponsor the Free & Fair Elections Joint Memorial when it comes before you in the next legislative session.

Respectfully,



Laurie Kurutz

However, although he was listed as a ""maybe"" on the online spreadsheet, my impression from talking to him is that he was actually more of a hard ""no"" before. I now feel like he is a ""maybe"" going forward, as I think we managed to improve his disposition toward the bill. We explained the misconception about the open vs. closed conventions, and I'm not sure how much he bought it or not, as he didn't really fully respond to that in particular (he just kind of narrowed his eyes and looked thoughtful). But he did repeatedly indicate that he would review the materials, so I think he at least is curious. He has introduced multiple campaign finance bills in the past, and I got the impression that his main problem with supporting the bill is that he gets a lot of people coming to him with their pet solutions for problems like campaign finance reform, and usually they haven't done enough research or really thought it through, and there are often some bigger or more complicated issues at play. He spoke at length about various situations in his experience as a legislator here in Oregon, and I got the impression that he sees himself as a ""details"" guy and that he is hesitant to support something that seems simplistic. But I think our points about the open vs. closed convention landed, and I think the fact that the bill has bipartisan support surprised him. We also emphasized that this bill doesn't actually overthrow Citizens United or anything like that, it simply puts a bunch of elected state officials like Senator Devlin in a room to discuss these very issues and to solve them. In essence we were trying to show him that our bill was the best way to achieve his own goals. I don't know if we really were able to drive that point home as much as I would have liked, but overall I feel like we planted some good seeds.

She could also have meant that he is unchanged from what he was before our meeting (essentially, opposed), although it's hard to say. His assistant is generally very hard to read, so I think it all amounts to zero new information.

He did say that he and his wife will take me to dinner when the first red state signs on. I told him I'd hold him to that. He also said that the way to approach Sen.

Alan DeBoer,Phil Guidotti,12/21/2016,Met Legislator,"I met with Senator Alan DeBoer along with Derek Scanlon. He will likely enter notes as well. Let's start with paraphrased quotes:
""We should simply ban corporate and union money from elections entirely, easy as that""
""Unions ARE corporations. They are a form of corporation. Union members have no choice in how the union contributes to campaigns.""
Other points:
1) He wants to focus on state and local level solutions. He did admit that he has a responsibility to reforming the federal government, but really focused on the local level. When running for Ashland mayor, he kept to voluntary campaign fundraising limits, while his opponent broke this promise. He also refrained from going negative in his campaign for state senate, while his opponent did not. He is a man of action and integrity, whether others around him are or not.
2) TV viewers shouldn't value advertisements. They should vote on candidates based on their bios (like in the voter's pamphlet). 
3) Salem legislators will bring 3000 bills forward, and the vast majority either don't do anything at all, or don't have a chance at passing (and the legislators know it!). He sees this as frivolous and without merit. Senate Republicans brought forward 18 bills in caucus this month, and none of them actually did anything (his words).
4) When told about our tremendous success in the past in gaining sponsors, he said they shine us on. They sign on knowing we don't have a chance to get through committee. (We don't fully agree with this, but his cynical words have some truth to them for sure).
5) He implied that our bill is another that doesn't really do anything, just calls for more talk. He really values more direct action. He really prefers local and state level reforms. We brought up the Montana decision to enact campaign finance reform that was struck down by the Supreme Court. He took notes on this. We also put this point in with a link to a WSJ article about this event in a follow up email. He must understand that all state level reforms will be subject to reversal at any time until we have an amendment.
6) He brought up Move to Amend. He was put off by how MtA flooded him with calls to push the anti-corporate campaign finance agenda. We did and continue to separate our group and our bill from these partisan agendas. He accepted this fact. He sees that we are not trying to disarm corporations and Republicans only to bolster unions and Demcrats. He sees MtA as a union front group. He sees us as professional citizen volunteer advocates looking for reform that benefits all Americans, Republican and Democrat alike. We must continue to earn this distinction.
In general, Senator DeBoer is quietly an issue supporter. It's important to him, even though it's not his top priority. He is learning about our bill and the Article V Process. Doubt he'd vote no, but unlikely to sponsor any time soon. We need to carefully and strategically keep working to advocate with him.",2 - Not Confirmed,OR
Sen. Richard Devlin,Marcella Martinson,12/2/2016,Met Legislator,"In Attendance: Johnathan DeBruyn, Marcella Martinson, Sen. Devlin, the Senator's aide.
From Jonathan's meeting notes: ""We explained the misconception about the open vs. closed conventions, and I'm not sure how much he bought (into) it or not, as he didn't really fully respond to that in particular (he just kind of narrowed his eyes and looked thoughtful). But he did repeatedly indicate that he would review the materials, so I think he at least is curious. He has introduced multiple campaign finance bills in the past, and I got the impression that his main problem with supporting the bill is that he gets a lot of people coming to him with their pet solutions for problems like campaign finance reform, and usually they haven't done enough research or really thought it through, and there are often some bigger or more complicated issues at play. He spoke at length about various situations in his experience as a legislator here in Oregon (including his being originally elected during the 2 yrs that OR had a campaign finance reform law in place), and I got the impression that he sees himself as a ""details"" guy and that he is hesitant to support something that seems simplistic. But I think our points about the open vs. closed convention landed, and I think the fact that the bill has bipartisan support surprised him. We also emphasized that this bill doesn't actually overthrow Citizens United or anything like that, it simply puts a bunch of elected state officials like Senator Devlin in a room to discuss these very issues and to solve them. In essence we were trying to show him that our bill was the best way to achieve his own goals. I don't know if we really were able to drive that point home as much as I would have liked, but overall I feel like we planted some good seeds. He was friendly and very kind, and very willing to talk at length about his views and his experience.",2 - Not Confirmed,OR

Spoke about a recent injury she had and the drugs she'd been put on, and joked we should have talked a few days ago when she was still taking them. Discussing the bill, when I pushed for her sense of how supportive Winters might be, she reiterated several times how ""thoughtful"" Winters is, which seemed to mean that she often doesn't make up her mind until she gets on the floor to vote and is quite unpredictable. She also said Winters (and she) read everything that comes across her desk, and that she has a strong work ethic (staying til 7:30 many nights, regular committee meetings on Saturdays). I empathized. She said ""the question she'd probably ask about is can this be limited,"" and I explained yes, Article V, DOJ, etc. She also said it might be more likely she'd support this because it's ""just an SJM"" and therefore it's just something we're asking Congress to do, not something that has immediate consequences or becomes law right away. Left on very good terms, she said she'd search her email to see if I'd already sent packet/handouts. She said it would be hard to meet with Winters but if it's a constituent they could arrange for Winters to say hi at the end of the meeting with staff (Pam or one of 3 others she's training). Overall still noncommittal - seems Winters' nature - but built a solid relationship in this conversation. ",2 - Not Confirmed,OR
Chuck Thomsen,Chris Chaplin,2/3/2017,Met Legislator,"Passed by his office, introduced myself as with Wolf PAC and thanked him for his continued support. He asked how it was going, I said we were setting up meetings and building support. He seemed discouraged on our odds of getting Peter Courtenay because he opposes lots of things - cited his 16 constituent bills that Courtenay will hold ""courtesy hearings"" on, and said it was the norm for lots of courtesy hearings to be held without any chance of bill passage. Said ""if they're not gonna pass it I wish they'd just tell you now instead of wasting your time."" Perhaps he was frustrated with his own lack of success with Courtenay. I suggested the possibility of him and Monroe meeting together with Courtenay, he seemed slightly open to it but said ""it's hard because I have to maintain my relationship with him."" Said Courtenay ""doesn't like controversy or anything controversial"" and it's understandable because ""he gets blamed for everything.""

to rewrite the constitution through a runaway convention. He insisted on this over and over.

We talked about the problem itself and he feels the best solution is full transparency, and furthermore he vbieves we can get that without an amendment. I talked about the failure of the DISCLOSE Act but he was not swayed.

Baertschiger,Jo6,2/27/2017,Met with staff,"After leaving two messages, one at 8:20am and at 10:50am, got a call from Michael Sellers at 11:46am, Sen. Baertschiger's LA, when I was half-way to Salem for our 12:30pm meeting, to tell me that the senator had been called away this afternoon and wouldn't be available but that he, Michael, would be happy to talk with me. Met Michael in the senator's office. He said the senator was very knowledgeable on SJM2, had gathered and read all sorts of info and was originally open to it and had been receptive to outreach on it, but after looking at the details for 9-12 months decided he didn't agree with it. When I asked why, Michael said he hadn't asked the senator. (They car pool three hours each way every Monday and Friday from Grants Pass.) He mentioned voter validity as something the senator was concerned with, and one person one vote, and that the senator believed in strong states, strong people and weak government. He also said that after Citizens United Congress created their own strict self-imposed rules limiting how much money they would be able to accept, but of course super-PACs could donate as much as they want. I said that we are not trying to overturn CU and that the senator could agree with CU AND with our bill and cited voter/donor. I offered that the senator's views should be on the table at the convention, since it will be a conversation with people from all points of view. Michael said he hadn't seen the info I provided to him today, so he'll read it and forward it to the senator. He also agreed to find out the senator's specific views on SJM2 and get back with me. We swapped business cards, I thanked him for his time and said I'll be looking forward to his call with the senator's views on SJM2.",3 - Unsupportive,OR

Richard Devlin,Jonathan DeBruyn,3/3/2017,Emailed legislator,"Not so great news to report, and the worst part is that it's all my fault. I set up a brief meeting with Senator Devlin in Salem on Friday, but amidst my whirlwind of graduate school auditions across the country and immense stress, I spaced on the meeting and stood him up. If anyone reading this feels like shooting me, I can provide my address and I'll even reimburse you for the bullets.

Thankfully it was just a 15-minute meeting, so although I wasted his time, it wasn't that much of his time. I emailed his assistant, and she responded kindly and said she'd talk to him about the issue. I hope I haven't damaged this relationship permanently, but it's hard to know. I sent a response detailing some of the broad support for this issue across the country, since his assistant mentioned that she knew of people working on this issue at the city and county level.

I never have felt Devlin was on board. He could surprise me, but I think he's too embroiled in the system. It's hard to say, though. But if this bill keeps gaining traction and he chooses to really look into the issue, the resources are all available to him. I wish I could have done better with all of this. But my suspicion is that the reason he only gave me a 15-minute meeting was because he was just being polite. I would encourage others to write to him, meet with him, and do whatever you can to show him that more people than one flaky, 24-year-old white boy care about this issue.",2 - Not Confirmed,OR

Gelser, however when we arrived the aide/intern, Brittany, said that Gelser was going to be in there with another meeting until about 4:15 about a ""serious"" issue. So, Brittany offered to meet with us instead. So she dragged out 3 chairs in front of Gelser's office. She wasn't familiar with the process so we gave her the basic info. She assumed we were from ""Convention of the States"" but eventually she found out we were representing Wolf PAC. She said they've been getting a lot of letters, ""but not from you."" She assumed that it was from this other group. We asked if she meant Move To Amend, but she didn't know. She brought up SJM 5, but she was mistaken about the subject matter. Gelser popped out of her very important meeting (in order to have another very important meeting scheduled AFTER us). She said that since we already met a ""couple weeks ago,"" we could meet with the staff and not have to cancel. She was dismissive and fake. We tried our best to engage her to get her on board, but she was trying to get rid of us. After we left, we convened and decided it was best for us to try to reschedule. Angela, chief of staff, said since Gelser already met with us and since she's ""really busy"" she said another meeting was not feasible. We asked Angela to talk with Gelser about cosponsoring. Mindy asked if she could check in via email in a week or two. We gave Angela the billback. She said she'd email us if Gelser will cosponsor or if Gelser talks with Burdick about it. Very frustrating meeting.",2 - Not Confirmed,OR
Lew Frederick,Jacob Strandlien,3/13/2017,Met Legislator,"Sara DeFrancesco attending.

Frederick agrees this issue should be addressed but does not believe Article V is the right way to do it. He is not convinced that a convention can remain limited. He strongly believes that a simple procedural vote at the convention could open it up to any topic. He is not convinced that 3/4 ratification is a sufficient barrier to a bad amendment due to how many legislatures are controlled by Republicans. Gave him some arguments and materials refuting these points and he said he would watch the issue.

He believes that the state's ability to recall delegates is impractical and cannot be done in the timeframe of a convention, and making the delegate recall argument really shut him down. --I recommend not bringing up the argument of recalling delegates up with Frederick unless you bring very detailed facts on the procedure to address his concern--

He claims he was threatened over email and in person by people claiming to be Wolf PAC volunteers in the 2016 session, and that did not help our cause. He agreed to look up a couple of those names and follow up with me.

When we handed him the Democrat packet he looked at the Atlantic article and mentioned liking Larry Lessig's work.",3 - Unsupportive,OR

Lee Beyer,Brandon Gigous & Griffin Moser,4/20/2017,Met Legislator,"Stopped in at a time Beyer would likely be there, and sure enough, he was. We wanted a quick meeting with him to address his concerns and to give him 135 petition signatures from his constituents (he didn't want them, but said he believed us that it was 135). He started by asking why we wanted a convention, we said because amendment is above SC and Congress won't do anything, and that it can be limited. He said it can't be limited. We mentioned that convention could be supervised by Congress and courts to make sure it stayed on topic. Then he went on about the Constitutional Convention of 1787 and that there's too much risk to hold a convention because of what happened then. We tried arguing with him on that point (Article V didn't exist at the time, you can't compare the two like that) but he stood firm.
He was concerned about delegate selection. We told him it's specifically written in our resolution that delegates must be state or locally elected officials. He scoffed at that, didn't believe we could control delegate selection. But he said if our bill comes to a floor vote, he would vote yes.
One last thing he said was that Congress giving in and proposing an amendment would be great, but if that doesn't happen then it's anyone's guess what happens at the convention. Beyer was concerned that if there was a convention, the red states would have the majority and and be able to propose an amendment or change the constitution how they see fit. We reiterated the fact that the convention must be limited and added that the fact it takes 38 states to ratify an amendment, and therefore it would be extremely unlikely America would vote for something that was not limited and rational. We said one final thing about it only taking one chamber in each of 13 states to stop an agenda from either side, but it didn't phase him much.",N/A,OR

Richard Devlin,"Jo6, Dr. X, Brandon",5/17/2017,Met with staff,"Devlin was busy, so we met with staff Megan and Morgan at 2:00. They said they talked to Devlin about SJM 2 in the morning. Said Devlin understands current lack of representation. He's not sure about the ability for the convention to be limited to a single topic, and with the low Democratic control at federal and state level he's worried that progressive ideas won't have a fair shot.
Jo brought up the consensus of the state: if states apply to address a specific issue, the convention must be limited to that topic. Also brought up that Congress and states have equal power in proposing amendments.
Megan reiterated and said that even if there was a consensus, Devlin is afraid that progressive views won't be expressed enough at the convention.
Dr. X chimed in, said that they may not, but this is a democracy. Even if there's only one thing---one sentence in the amendment--that we all agree with, it's a good thing. This seemed to strike a chord.
Megan asked if Wolf PAC is more about the celebration of the Article V process, or about solving the money in politics issue. Jo approached the question by saying that Congress CAN'T fix this issue, but the states can. Dr. X added that the Constitution was created by geniuses/revolutionaries. They created a document that has lasted this long; they knew that there would be times where the document needed to be amended.
Morgan asked about what the experts say about a convention being limited. Jo said the DOJ report is the expert knowledge we go by.
We then talked about delegates. Megan asked what's stopping the states from telling the delegates to fight for campaign finance reform at the convention ALONG WITH some other issue. Example: California sends delegates to talk about CFR; Oregon instructs delegates to talk about CFR AS WELL AS term limits. Jo answered by saying the states give the delegates a mandate; ""this is why you're going.""
Morgan inquired about the ""temperature"" in the state capitol. Jo mentioned our primary sponsors (2 Ds, 1 R), and that we have cosponsors from both sides.
Megan said that Devlin has proposed change to state constitution regarding campaign finance reform, but his legislation didn't get through. The conversation moved back to consensus, and Jo made the point that it's difficult to get consensus even at the state level. They shook their heads. They said our overall conversation was helpful.
Then before we left, Megan mentioned she actually studied the Constitution and she may look more into Article V. She also brought up some popular vote proposal (that I forget the name of), and we talked about that a little.",2 - Not Confirmed,OR
Lew Frederick,Elaine Mellon,5/17/2017,Met Legislator,"Jo Six, Phil, and Elaine meet with him during Citizen Action Day at the capital. We were greeted by Glendora Claybrooks, his assistant, whom Jo was familiar with. 
Jo introduced our intentions and Senator agrees our goal is appropriate. He continues to hold the fear that a convention is a set up to be taken over by extreme right overtones, especially with the majority of legislatures controlled by Republicans. Even after Phil explained in detail the process of keeping the convention limited, he still does not trust the enforcement for recalling delegates who go off topic, does not trust Congress from changing the rules, and further does not trust the climate of the Supreme Court. This is backed up by his conversations with former members of Congress, and awareness of the alt-Right.
He said it was good to see list of supporting organizations who have signed on with us. He also appreciated our respectful exchange, and brought up that last time he met with WolfPac he was threatened by one of our reps.

She seems to agree with our issue, and has some comfort with the Article V process. Even so, we went over the enforcement options for a limited convention, as detailed in the DOJ report. She still had the same idea- that she wanted to see her constituents educated on Article V in town halls before agreeing to sponsor our bill or commit to supporting it.

Betsy Johnson,Joseph Stevenson,5/17/2017,Met Legislator,"Unscheduled meeting. I happened to be standing in her office when she emerged, recognized me, and asked what she could do for me. When I asked for a brief meeting she said, ""How about now?"" and we sat down in two nearby chairs. I piggybacked on previous conversations we'd had in the past where she had supported the issue, briefly sketching out the Article V process when she indicated that she was not familiar with it, and asked her, in light of the difficulty we've had even getting a vote in committee in the Oregon legislature, whether she had any advice on how to make progress on the issue. She was blunt about not having a clue and we devolved into talking about specific examples of money corrupting politics. Her examples were (1) Sen. Jeff Merkeley's incessant fundraising, and (2) organized labor's lobbying and PAC money, I pointed out how both Sanders and Trump had used the issue to their own advantage because the American people were overwhelmingly sick and tired of their representatives being bought off, leaving us the the chaos that's now playing out. 
My impression is that while Sen Johnson is immersed in other issues -- and she is certainly a major force in the legislature -- she wd probably be a yes vote if our bill got a vote on the floor but is unlikely to take up the issue with other senators. We have a good rapport, and I know I have a lot of friends here in her district who would speak up if there was a vote pending. Just to be clear, she is as close to being a Republican as you can be in Oregon and still call yourself a Democrat, but she is extremely popular in her district and shows up in person at many many local events.",2 - Not Confirmed,OR
Steiner-Hayward,Jan Deininger,5/17/2017,Met with staff,"We met with aides ellie Forness, who knew a little about it, and Michael Earle, his first session, anthropology major. Ellie said the Senator is passionate about the National Popular Vote. Jo told a story about a joyful win we had; and how passionate we are and unpaid.
Ellie didn't know where the Senator stood right now.

Jo and Bob went over the basics I wondered if ""hijacked convention"" should come up, in case the Senator was being influenced. Bob did go over how a convention was limited and I told Micael (Ellie left early) that the fact that a state convention had never happened, caused a lot of confusion and I hoped the Senator would get with us on questions.

Michael asked a little more on keeping it on topic, and Jo gave an exposition on how getting off topic would make it extremely hard to propose anything because 1) delegates who get off topic can be recalled and 2) there has to be 2/3 consensus just to propose and that is exponentially more difficult to get if multiple topics are under discussion. (But she made it more concrete and intuitive.)

Michael suggested we follow up in a couple of days.",1 - Supportive,OR
James Hansell,Jan Deininger,5/17/2017,Met Legislator,"Ann Rava receptionist. Mansell said he didn't think he would support our bill because of unions: If money from corporations is not allowed then the same should be true of unions. (He said Republicans get their money from corporations!)
Bob gave a talk about the fact this bill is for having that discussion. Unions could be part of that. I said one Republican--who supports our bill--suggests that one make it illegal for out of state money to be donated in in-state elections.
Jo asked him what would be his suggestion and he said that any bill should have 10% (of the body) bipartisan support--so if 30 senators, if 3 co-sponsors on 1 side there should be 3 on the other. (Of course he's a 30-year veteran in the minority party! And that would mean that a greater percentage of the minority party present would have to sponsor a bill--thus giving more power to the minority members to extract concessions from bill introducers in the majority party.)
I suggested corporate influence impacted rural areas disproportionately in a negative way. He didn't agree. He said Tillamook couldn't grow more cows, lack of land & can't dump methane there due to high water table. His area can so his area supplies milk. (I had mention vertical business model--where corporation takes control of growing, processing, shipping, etc. and get a monopoly--and I mentioned environmental degradation where corporations dump their bi-products in low-population areas.)
He said he would read about the bill. He does a radio address 8:15 am mid-columbia radio every week or so. (I don't remember the day of the week.)",3 - Unsupportive,OR

But at this time sense he can only introduce one bill, he has committed himself to another bill. He said he would look into trying to find someone who be willing to introduce SJM2 in the short session but that it didn't look good at this time. He said there were a few people he could talk to but wouldn't give any names without their ok. He did emphasize that Sen Pres. Courtney was the key person wolfpac needed talk to make sure things happen sooner rather than later. And next would be the Speaker of the House. He did say he want to work with wolfpac toward getting a bill introduced at some point. And could someone from the wolfpac state level contact him to work together on something for the future. Also that it would be wise to reach out to some republicans. There is more than a few who aren't comfortable with the present financial system as it is.

Asked if he could support it, said he wanted to read it first, so he did. He will cosponsor if the bill doesn't change.

Paul and Dawn also attended. Tony sat us down, then Sen. Olsen welcomed us in. We started talking about Canby, but then we started talking business. Paul said we want free and fair elections, Olsen said that elections should definitely be free and fair, at least fairer than they are now. I said we are aiming to add an amendment to the US Constitution, through an Article V convention. He asked right away: ""Can you limit it?"" I brought up that when states start calling for convention, the applications form a consensus on what could be talked about. But he was worried that the delegates would be disproportionate (more Ds than Rs). Paul corrected him, saying Rs have more state house control. Still, Olsen was a bit wary, saying most of the population is Democratic. Olsen started reading the bill. Tony joined in at some point.

One thing that Tony asked while Olsen was reading was: why don't we just make Oregon a model state for campaign finance? I tried saying we have to be careful because Montana had campaign finance laws that were struck down as a result of Citizens United. I tried to say that we're supportive of state reform, we're just using another tool of democracy available to get this issue fixed, but Olsen was done reading the bill, so I directed my attention back to him.",1 - Supportive,OR

Chuck Thomsen,Phil Guidotti,9/19/2017,Met Legislator,"Senator Thomsen is a great advocate for us. He met with Senator Courtney on our behalf, and he found out some very useful information. The Senate President doesn't introduce bills for amendment conventions. Not ever. Doesn't matter what the issue is (national popular vote, campaign finance reform, etc), he won't ever support the process per Senator Thomsen. He says all these issues should be referred to the people instead, like a referendum or something. Is he talking about state level legislation? Is there a mechanism for national level referendum? This seems strange. John of Senator Thomsen's office was going to email us something back about it. Seems like a misconception the Senate President has, which seems unlikely since he's been in office forever and he's a lawyer. If we can figure out what referring the national issue to the people means, maybe we can clear this up. The ironic thing is that, according to the Founders, the Article V Convention process is THE WAY you refer huge reform issues to the people, via their state legislatures. We need to figure this out with President Courtney to have a chance.",1 - Supportive,OR
Alan DeBoer,Phil Guidotti,9/19/2017,Met Legislator,Senator DeBoer has heard from other groups working on campaign finance reform.

She did acknowledge that any amendment proposed would need to reach the high threshold of ratification by 3/4 states. She thinks the main cause for division in the country is that we don't talk to people across the aisle, not because of money in politics. We brought up the polls that show public distaste for Congress; her response - the other side of that poll is that people do like their own representative.

Very quickly, Dave, the resolution you have referenced was presented in the last legislative Session, 2015-2016. When a legislative Session ends, all bills and resolutions not voted on are deemed void. Thus , the process must start over again in a future Session, if the issue is to be considered. I am not aware of a similar resolution being considered at this time. All that said, I would almost certainly vote ‘No’ on such a measure. While I understand there are folks who believe that invoking the Article 5 rights will fix everything that is wrong (in their view) in this country, I am highly suspicious of the actual process of implementation of such a Constitutional Convention. Until I am satisfied that a truly uncompromised group of people can be found to form a committee, I believe that politics will be the rule of the day. Who will be Chairperson? Someone I like, or someone you like? Who can vote on changes? How will members be picked to be empaneled ? Who picks the topics to be discussed/ acted upon? And perhaps most importantly, how in the world can the issues be limited, once the Convention is seated? I do not believe they can, despite assurances of today’s supporters. We have a functioning Constitution which I aim to preserve. Tinkering with it by present day ‘experts’ is, in my view, very dangerous to the health of the country. Please take me off the list of possible supporters. I’m not your man. Rep. Lee James
----

Representative James - First off, thank you for the quick and thoughtful reply. I appreciate taking time out of your busy day to respond.

Yes, Rep. Cox recently re-introduced the resolution, same number as last session: HR 357: http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billInfo/billInfo.cfm?sYear=2015&sInd=0&body=H&type=R&bn=357. 

I understand your concerns surrounding an Article V Convention and concerns about opening our Constitution to broad changes.

We've researched this issue quite a bit, and I want to share my quick thoughts on your concerns:

Article V Convention Can Be Limited to One Topic
The Congressional Research Service, American Bar Association, and The Dept of Justice have all agreed that an Article V Convention can be limited to one topic. There are currently over 700 different calls for conventions across the US. They cannot be combined into one convention. Moreover, our resolution specifically says that the convention must be limited to one topic.

Article V Convention is a conversation - still needs to be ratified by States to Amend Constitution
One of the best checks/balances for our Constitution is that we need 2/3 (34) of the States to call a Convention, and then 3/4 (38) of the States to ratify the convention to amend the Constitution. It's an almost impossibly high bar, which is why we haven't had a convention in history. The only Amendments that would have a chance to pass this bar would be those that had strong bi-partisan support in every state. Not only that, but whatever Amendments were proposed at the convention would need to be agreed to by 3/4 of the states. So partisan or broad amendments would not pass that aforementioned bar due to the sheer amount of states that would have to agree to it.

Checks/Balances Straight from the Founding Fathers
Finally, and this one is the most convincing to me, is that many of our current amendments started as State Convention Calls. Those Amendments ended up being passed by Congress because of the political pressure they felt from States who united on those topics. So even if there are concerns with what will happen at the Article V Convention, we should still use this very powerful tool to pressure Congress to act.

The Founding Fathers specifically outlined Article V as a way for States to call for action in case US Congress was unable to take action. We believe this is the current case; Congress is unable to deal with the influence of money in politics and therefore needs a loving intervention. 

I hope some of this information is helpful. We are in agreement that we want to avoid tinkering unnecessarily with the Constitution; However, I believe strongly that our amendment is necessary to protect the voices of the average citizen, those without the ability to use political influence and money to protect their rights.

I appreciate you hearing me out; Rep Cox is also an excellent resource for discussion on Article V. He is the sponsor of this resolution and if you are interested, he would be a good colleague to discuss with.

Rep James - thank you for the time.",3 - Unsupportive,PA

Gave an example of how it cost money to print brochures to get out information on a candidate. I then asked if he felt any part of our election system needed improvement and besides preventing voter fraud (voter ID laws were a step in the right direction, he indicated), he did not think any improvement was needed. He feels that the will of the voters is served and has ""high confidence"" in our elections. He did note a concern for echo chambers and fake news on social media but felt that this was more a problem for communities to solve. 

It may be helpful to ask him if he feels that the FEC needs improvement.

Rep Pope will not stand with us if it means standing against his friend and colleague, and ultimately the man who will decide the issue, Representative Delleney. He's not willing to pick a fight that he knows we will lose on account of the Bircher fears that Delleney holds.

Hello Representative Gilmore,

I wanted to send a quick email to introduce myself (a constituent in your house district) and request to meet with you.

My name is Benjamin Wachter, and I have resided in your district for about 4 years. I am an electronics technician (repairing pro audio gear for the musician community) and have been wary of politics for some time. In light of the recent events that have taken place on the federal level, my concern has inspired me to become more active here in our state, and reach out to my representatives.

That being said, a resolution for Free & Fair Elections has been introduced into a number of states, requesting an Article 5 convention. I would like to request an opportunity to meet with you to discuss this resolution and talk about what this might look like in our great state. Would you be willing to set an appointment to discuss corporate money in politics and what we can do here in Tennessee?

Thank you for your time and, most of all, your service.

Sincerely,

Benjamin Wachter

She was a bit taken aback and stated she needed more information before making a statement about such a resolution. So, I backed up a bit and asked how she felt about Citizens United - she did seem concerned by that legislation. Then I asked how she felt about the role of corporate money in the political system. She stated that she did feel it caused some serious issues. She agreed to look over some documents, if I sent them via email.

It's called the Resolution to Restore Free and Fair Elections in the United States. So far, at least five other states have passed similar resolutions and I would love to see our great state join them.

I have attached a pdf copy, and hope you might review and give me your honest opinion.

Thank you so much for your work,

Benjamin Wachter",N/A,TN

""Representative Gilmore,

I’m a citizen of your district and I’d like to talk to you about an important resolution that aims to fix the corruption happening in Washington, D.C. by restoring Free and Fair Elections in America. The purpose of this Resolution is to clean up our election system so that the voices of average Americans don’t continue to be drowned out by big money and special interests. From reviewing the bills you’ve sponsored and co-sponsored, it is evident that you care deeply about the social justice of your constituents.

I wanted to send a quick email to introduce myself (a constituent in your house district) and request to meet with you.

My name is Benjamin Wachter, and I have resided in your district for about 4 years. I am an electronics technician (repairing pro audio gear for the musician community) and have been wary of politics for some time. In light of the recent events that have taken place on the federal level, my concern has inspired me to become more active here in our state, and reach out to my representatives.

That being said, a resolution for Free & Fair Elections has been introduced into a number of states, requesting an Article 5 convention. I would like to request an opportunity to meet with you to discuss this resolution and talk about what this might look like in our great state. Would you be willing to set an appointment to discuss corporate money in politics and what we can do here in Tennessee?

Thank you for your time and, most of all, your service.

I told him that a new version would be presented in the next session. He said he had also heard of this. 
In principal, because of the need to exercise some control over the electoral process, and as we cannot depend on Congress or the Executive branch to exercise that control, he is generally in favor of an Article V convention, provided that the language of the new bill coming is adequate to the changes and corrections demanded when it was last presented and declined.

He will support the bill, but he won't run the bill just because he has ""too many bills as is."" He said the best thing to do will be to have a republican who is well respected run the bill and who is not in a leadership position because leaders have a lot of bills as is. Republicans he said who would be good, although he doesn't know if they support it or not are: Steve Handy, Steve Eliason, Todd Weiler, Deidre Henderson, Lowry Snow, Mike McKell, Paul Ray, or Jim Dunnigan. Rep. King also brought up with conservatives it's a good idea to bring up how there is a fear of a concentration of power of government in the hands of a few aka oligarchs. We also discussed how even with campaign finance reform a group of people can still get together, mostly who have a lot of money, and use that money to support the canidate in a way such as advertising.

Let me be what I am best. 100% honest. I love the idea of wrecking Citizens United. I think it single handedly has the possibility to destroy the Republic. It is that serious of an issue.

However, I think a Constitutional Convention is a very bad idea. Once convened, it cannot not be limited (who would do that?). It opens pandora's box to a very ugly possibilities. Imagine who would represent Utah in such a convention---Mike Lee or Ken Ivory--repairing the work of Jefferson and Madison. Unthinkable.

I will not support a constitutional convention. It risks to much.

If you and your organization can find another way to reverse Citizens United that would be great. I am terrifically supportive!

""Dear Mr. Graves,

My name is Arshish Kapadia, and I am one of your new constituents in District 5. I live in Issaquah with my wife and two daughters, not far from you. Congratulations on your recent election victory! I’m really looking forward to the impact you will have in effecting change for the benefit of us all. 

I’m writing to you to request your support on a legislative issue that I care about – namely the potentially corrosive effect of money in politics. I’m not typically a politically active person, but in this particular case I’m reaching out because I’m particularly passionate about this subject. Moreover, I believe this particular issue already enjoys broad bi-partisan support and hence becomes something that is actually achievable, given the polarization of political viewpoints today. 

I hope you will be able to spare 10-15 minutes of your time to meet with me and chat about this, at your convenience, sometime in the near future. I had reached out to you over the telephone as well a few days back, and thought I would follow up over email since I hadn’t heard back. 

I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

Arshish C. Kapadia

Paul Graves,Arshish Kapadia,12/27/2016,Met Legislator,"My wife and I attended a meeting with Paul Graves from 9 am-9:30 am @ Issaquah Coffee Company. It was my first meeting with him. We talked about some sample instances of corruption in the campaign finance system. Paul tried hard to mostly refute the points I brought up; he rarely agreed that there was a problem, leading me to think he doesn't support this legislation, but I need to follow up more to confirm. Paul seems to be a proponent of disclosure ""if everyone discloses everything, this addresses the bulk of the problem"". I pointed out that the average voter won't have the bandwidth to parse all the disclosure data and that disclosures don't address the fundamental conflict of interest at the heart of the problem. Paul seems to be for Citizens United (free speech is paramount) and appears to think it is impossible to separate excessive campaign donations under Citizens United from the initial premise - to protect free speech. The only time Paul seemed receptive was when I explained that the limited convention we called for was open to discussing non-specific ways to achieve the goals AND when I said that we wanted attendance to be limited to state and local electees or special appointees and that Federal electees were not eligible. he said ""Oh, that's interesting"".

Dear Jon,

Thank you for contacting me regarding the Convention of States/Article V. Jon, I respect your desire to fight corruption in the political process. I believe this movement comes from a good place, but in its current form I cannot support it. Personally, I cannot get past the fact that billionaire George Soros is funding this effort. For years Mr. Soros has back political efforts I do not support, and has generously donated to this cause (and Wolf PAC) which makes me suspicious about the real reason he is supporting this. Additionally, there are many Constitutional reasons why I do not support this.

Paul Graves,Alek McCune,3/11/2017,Met Legislator,"I put in a handwritten question to Graves. The question was whether his position on getting money out of politics would extend to supporting limited amendment convention. He stated the question in front of the Issaquah Town Hall meeting, today, and answered by saying he would be ""reluctant to support a Constitutional amendment. He felt there was a, ""risk of damage to political speech."" He referenced oral arguments in Citizens United, there the Solicitor General conceded that the law, at the time, could allow for there to be a, ""a ban on books about candidates."" Paul Graves then moved onto to say he is very open to meeting with people.
I believe Paul Graves is unsupportive of the Amendment idea. He was able to cite to a specific reason why he felt Citizens United was correctly decided. He was willing to defend Citizens United on its merits, by using a conservative talking point about how the minority positions would allow for books to be banned. My question made no mention of Citizens United, yet Grave was happy to take it there.",3 - Unsupportive,WA

Mentioned my concern as a Washington State District 44 voter that large sums of corporate cash combined with just a few rich donors are unfairly influencing national election politics in a way which drowns out our individual voices. 

Pointed out that it psychologically skews the national debate in America and in Congress. To the unfortunate result of Congress just paying attention to special interests with big money and other addictive incentives, to then offer up the public only shallow and manipulative legislation which favors those big donor interests. 

Congress has been unable to deal this problem so I need the Representative's opinion, his action plans, and his help at the state level to deal with this issue. 

Proposed that the People of Washington State need to take action using Article V of the U.S. Constitution to call for a limit amendment designed specifically to end this ugly trend in U.S. politics by restoring Free and Fair elections. 

It has reached a sad tipping point, especially after the election of billionaire Donald Trump. 

Mentioned that I am joining several groups to work on this issue including the 44th LD Democrats General Meeting.

Asked again, for the Representative's opinion on using the Article V amendment option and for any information on action plans he is currently working on to address this subject. Was he open to helping to get such an specifically designed Article V amendment passed in the state legislature?

She had been approached by people representing the Republican's version of a call for a convention and didn't like what they were presenting. I pointed out that our group was different, that we focused on one point (getting money out of elections) and asked if I could send her articles to help educate her on our cause. She said yes. I emailed the two articles (The Logical Path to End Corruption and The Honest Path to Save Democracy), as well as asked her to cosponsor our bill. If she still had questions or reservations I asked her to keep the dialogue going. She's very approachable and seems thoughtful. However, I am concerned that she may be sponsored/bought by big pharma. In my discussions with her about optometry, she seemed to be defending that entity.

Mike Sells,Kyle,5/18/2017,Emailed legislator,"Mike replied to my email/notice about SJM 8000. His reply was short, and I gather than he is supportive of the idea but concerned about the execution. 

his email reply to me:
I agree that dealing with the issue of money in politics needs to be done. However, as much as proponents say you can open a constitutional convention on one issue, others will tell you that once started--any issue can be taken up for changing the constitution. That has me very concerned.

Mike Sells, State Representative
38th Legislative District

And my reply I sent today:
""Representative Mike Sells,
Thanks for the prompt reply. It means a lot to me that you find the time to read, consider, and reply to me. It assures me that you are my voice in our state congress. 

That had me concerned too, I am a cautious man after all, and I get the impression you are too. For despite any flaws it has, our constitution has kept us safe, stable, and prosperous for over 200 years, some caution is warranted. 

So it's not lightly that I desire changes, and after reading (well, audio booking mostly) from knowledgeable and esteemed sources such as Elizabeth Warren and Ken Buck I became convinced that an amendment (or more than one) are needed. And according to a DOJ report ""The paper concludes that Article V permits the states to apply for, and the Congress to call, a constitutional convention for limited purposes, and that a variety of practical means to enforce such limitations are available. ""

The DOJ report is pretty long, and I'm no legal scholar myself, but I trust it's summary of which I quoted. Here's the link since I wouldn't ask you to take my word for it.
https://www.i2i.org/files/2013/08/Limited-Article-V-Convention-Attorney-General.pdf

So I believe there are 4 reasons you can feel confident that a convention is safe:
1) While a state summoned convention and the congress of the united states are considered equal authorities to propose an amendment, you best believe that if congress senses that there is enough support for it that they will propose the amendment themselves just so they can proudly point to something they have done. So I don't expect the convention to ever take place, but quite a few states will need to step up to the plate to show that there is the kind of support that will make congress take note.
2) According to the DOJ report the convention would only be authorized to address limited topics.
3) The convention would be attended by the states elected representatives, people like you. Perhaps you yourself, if you wish, and you can be sure that many like minded people of serious intent who will be dedicated to keep the topic of the convention on track. 
4) Even should a convention go astray and come to propose an amendment that's wildly off topic it would still require ratification by 3/4 of the states in the union. And even with broad (90%+ popular support) the air of illegitimacy that would come from being brought by a convention that wasn't called to address that issue in particular would probably sink it, because as you expressed: the idea of a convention going astray is very concerning. (though if it had that much support, convening a new convention, or congress proposing the the amendment itself, would likely follow)

Now personally I don't think 'campaign finance reform' is enough. So I hope I'm wrong about point 1, because it might make it easier to call conventions in the future to deal with other loopholes such as cushy lobbying positions for those retired congressmen/women as payment for their years of service to their donors. But while I want broader change than SJM 8000's convention would be permitted to propose, I'm not about to turn down a steak dinner just because I'm hungry enough to eat a horse. 

In other news: I've found another measure, SJM 8003, which also proposes a convention. It has a wider remit, dealing with 3 topics, and I haven't finished reading it. (and parsing legal text isn't my strong suit) But I am tentatively in favor of that one as well. If you remove your concern about any topic being taken up at a convention, and focus just on the topics of ""fiscal restraints on the federal government, the power and jurisdiction of the federal government, and terms of office for federal officials and for members of Congress."" What does that entail? I gather that a balanced budget amendment would be possible from that, but what else? What are your thoughts on the matter? 

Again, thank you so much for the correspondence with me. """,1 - Supportive,WA

Hello Representative Mike Steele and LA Wanda Brosey,

I tried calling your office.  You were out so I figured an email would be easier to respond to than a voice mail.

My name is Willow Thompson and I am concerned about money in elections.  The Free and Fair Elections  / HJM 4003 is something I really care about.  It deals with restoring balance and integrity to our elections at the federal level so that the voices of average citizens aren't drowned out by special interest, from both the left and the right, and our elections work better for all Americans.

I am hoping to speak with you regarding your part in the Assembly of State Legislator convention rules last year and where you now stand on constitutional amendment proposals via convention of states. I'm from the 39th, but Rep. Kristansen said you were the expert on article V calls and indicated that his opinion would follow yours. So since there are at least two votes riding on your expertise I would like to know where you stand on SJM8000 and 8003, and would appreciate your insight and reasons behind your opinions. 

I'm working with American Promise and Wolf PAC to pass the Free and Fair Elections Resolution (SJM800, HJM4003), and have also testified on behalf of the Convention Of States call for amendment (HJM4006, SJM8003).

I'm actually writing about the Free and Fair Elections resolution (SJM8000, HJM4003) which is something that I really care about. I know it's early and session doesn't start until January, but I wanted to get a word in while there was still time. Myself and thousands of volunteers across the country are trying to restore balance and integrity to our elections with a U.S. Constitutional Amendment so that the voices of average citizens aren’t drowned out by special interests (from both the left and right) and our elections work better for all Americans. I think it's the lynchpin for solving most of the problems we're seeing nationally right now. I would love to meet with you to talk about this resolution and answer any questions or concerns you might have. I hope we can count on your support.

Hello, I hope you are all well this evening, and thanks for all of your hard work on behalf of the people in the State of Washington. I'm writing to you to urge you to support Constitutional Amendment #28 for Free and Fair elections. I am happy to meet with you, to help convey the necessity of this. I have attached the relevant Wolf-PAC documents here for your information. This is not a party issue, but important to our democracy as a whole. If our democracy is effectively ruled by an small elite group, simply based on how much money they have instead of their concern for their fellow citizens, then it is not a democracy at all.

Joe Fain,Daniel Sugano,12/16/2016,Emailed legislator,"Response Letter from Senator Joe Fain:

Dear Daniel,

Thank you for contacting me about election spending in our country.

I am a strong supporter of campaign finance laws that promote transparency and accountability to the voters. On the state level, I co-sponsored Senate Bill 5153, increasing transparency of campaign contributions. This piece of legislation would have closed some of the loopholes in Washington’s already strong campaign finance laws to provide better clarity within our community.

It is important that our state is a leader in campaign finance transparency in order to be a model for the rest of the country. While I am not opposed to a constitutional amendment on this topic, the devil is very much in the details. As an ardent advocate for free and open expression, I want to ensure that any future legislation or amendments do not harm an individual's right of free speech.

This is an incredibly important issue and I appreciate your advocacy and desire to find balance. Please do not hesitate to reach out about this or any other matter as we approach a new legislative session.

Best wishes,

Joe Fain

He was in the House last year and said he just couldn't devote the time to this that he needed to, and he didn't hear from hundreds of constituents like he does on other issues.

Brad Hawkins,Kyle Northcott,1/24/2017,Phone Conference Call/Meeting,"Sen Hawkins, Alison Hartson(in person), Sarah Bakke Knudsen(phone), Kyle Northcott(phone). Sen Hawkins seems to understand and be receptive to the movement based on his responses. He stated that hearing from constituents was the most important thing for him to make a decision about supporting the bill. He needs to hear from more people in our District. He said he was beginning to be swayed by our meeting and the opinions and motivations of Sarah and myself. He says he has personally seen how legislators lose touch with common citizens after they have been elected and that he understands our frustration with the amount of time elected officials have to spend fundraising instead of governing. He sympathizes that common citizens have very little influence on Federal Lawmakers decisions. He seemed to understand that state legislators such as him are the best shot for common citizens to have influence on the government, because he has meetings and phone calls with constituents while most Federal Incumbents only communicate with those inside their circles. He respects that Wolf PAC is a grassroots movement, and this is our best way to influence him. We need to push to get more constituents to contact him. While he was in the House he said he thought that this issue should be handled by the Federal Government because that is where the problem is, but I think that this meeting started persuaded him to understand that they don't want to address this issue because it pays them. He is unsure about giving this issue the amount of time it would need in the legislature because there are many other issues that he thinks are more important. Alison made a great point that although many people can't see it, this issue underlies almost all of the other issues that our country is facing.

Dear Senator Miloscia,

I implore you to pass SJM out of committee this week. I am very grateful for your support and co-sponsorship of this bill. 

The disproportionate influence of special interests, wealthy individuals, and corporations is a disgrace to our republic. I can't imagine you enjoy spending so much of your time campaigning, and I know it's not a good use of time for our representatives at local, state or federal levels. 

I suppose you know all this, though--you are a co-sponsor. Please pass this out of committee. It's a non-partisan issue.

Sincerely,
Natalie Franz

Mentioned my concern as a Washington State District 44 voter that large sums of corporate cash combined with just a few rich donors are unfairly influencing national election politics in a way which drowns out our individual voices. 

Pointed out that it psychologically skews the national debate in America and in Congress. To the unfortunate result of Congress just paying attention to special interests with big money and other addictive incentives, to then offer up the public only shallow and manipulative legislation which favors those big donor interests. 

Congress has been unable to deal this problem so I need the Senator's opinion, his action plans, and his help at the state level to deal with this issue. 

Proposed that the People of Washington State need to take action using Article V of the U.S. Constitution to call for a limit amendment designed specifically to end this ugly trend in U.S. politics by restoring Free and Fair elections. 

It has reached a sad tipping point, especially after the election of billionaire Donald Trump. 

Mentioned that I am joining several groups to work on this issue including the 44th LD Democrats General Meeting.

Asked again, for the Senator's opinion on using the Article V amendment option and for any information on action plans he is currently working on to address this subject. Was he open to helping to get such an specifically designed Article V amendment passed in the state legislature?

Jennifer Smolen said she would pass my concerns to Senator Steve Hobbs. 

She mentioned that Senator Steve Hobbs had sent a memo to the Democratic Party upstream expressing his concern about big donor cash. 

Additionally, she worried about the nature of a Constitutional Convention getting out of hand. 

I mentioned that looking over the text of Article V of the U.S. Constitution, such a proposed amendment could be constructed to only cover this specific issue. 

Mentioned that I am joining several groups to work on this issue including the 44th LD Democrats General Meeting.

She mentioned that Robert Reich was forming a group to lobby against big donor cash. 

I said I was aware of his work. And that this was great but we need to address this critical problem at all levels of government all at the same time. It is very important. 

Jennifer Smolen agreed to email me some information (and their memo) which they were aware of on this big donor issue.

Hello James, 

Thanks again for your call. These links above are what I’ve found in my initial search. Their language does not necessarily focus on money and the Citizens United decision by name, but they are statements that show state-level elected officials, Senator Hobbs included, are not on board with how these very concerning topics are going nationally. Hope these help for starters. I’ll continue to look for another item, a letter I remember from earlier in the session. 

We welcome your thoughts and ideas, and while we are too late in this legislative session for dropping new bills, perhaps we could collaborate on a letter or some other communication addressed to our federal elected officials that more specifically describes the concerns you raise. The best time for this would be once session is over next month. (Or closer to the end, anyway.) But we can certainly have conversations and start planning before then. 

I’ll pass your comments on to the Senator, and I’ll look forward to chatting and listening again soon. 

Best,

John McCoy,Kyle,5/17/2017,Emailed legislator,"I sent an email through the WA state legislature website. It was sent to Senator John McCoy and also Rep. June Robinson and Rep. Mike Sells. 

It was pretty easy with the website, it let me select a bill I was commenting about, which also apparently makes it so that my comment is visible to every legislator. Assuming I read that right, about the 'bill comments field' just being to select a bill#. It also let me send the message to June and Mike too. 

In retrospect I think I should have swapped paragraph 1 and 2 of my message, so that it ended with a request for progress rather than the plea for support. 

subject: I want you to support SJM8000 (and it's companion bill), and want to know it's progress.

Message:
Removing money from politics is super important. Please help to ensure that our government works for us. I want to know the progress of the bill and what arguments there are on both sides (since it seems pretty one sided to me, but if it were that simple it would have been passed already.) 

I am fuming mad at our politics (particularly our federal politics). The partisanship, the corruption, and how a system of perverse incentives seems custom crafted to weed out our best and ensure that our representatives don't serve us. Campaign finance reform seems like a good place to start. We need to have this conversation, so please pass 8000 to get the conversation started. ",N/A,WA

I hope the USDA position is good for you, I know you'll be greatly missed by more than just me. Thank you for your time and listening to your constituents. You were the first legislator I met, I was taken by your kindness and your strength, and it made it worth the trip to get a wave and a hug between hearings. I don't think you are replaceable as the legislature's moral compass, but I will hope for that. I'm comforted that you can be a voice for small farms across the country, and I hope you take the power to be that. Maybe we'll be able to legally buy and sell raw milk... ? :) 

Celice Carlough, Wolf PAC's former organizing director, wrote and said
""He was always so nice to us and honest about why he would not support us. I. Appreciated that.""

Again, thank you for your time and support, as much as you could give. I'm proud to have you as my senator and I don't think my trips to Olympia will be as much fun without you there. 

Yours,

Spoke with Ms. Prange for about 15 minutes. She had heard of the Resolution, it is apparently being talked about enough that she had heard of it but didn't know details. I went over with her what we are calling for in terms of the Article V convention. We discussed the 17th amendment history. She was also concerned about runaway convention, so went over Limited Convention, the mandate in the resolution about only covering this topic, and the fact that Justice Department says that this is safe and legal. She said that she didn't know Senator Marklein's thoughts on the resolution, but at this point they would wait and see what happened with the resolution.

Ms. Prange and Senator Marklein,

It was wonderful to meet with Chief of Staff Prange last week to discuss the Free and Fair Elections Resolution. As we discussed the purpose of the resolution is to call for an Article V Convention to propose a constitutional amendment in order to restore balance and 

integrity to our elections that will permanently protect free and fair elections in America by addressing issues raised by the decisions of the United States Supreme Court in Citizens United and related cases and events.

I, along with 87% of American Citizens, are very concerned about how money in politics is corrupting the response to issues on both the left and the right. For example when special interests lobbying Congress force unfunded mandates on State governments, requiring them to spend money without providing sufficient resources to adhere to those mandates. Or look at the results of the recent vote on allowing importation of medications from Canada. The Amendment vote didn't break and fail along party lines, it was found pretty quickly that our Senator's actually voted along the lines of who funded their campaigns and SuperPac's rather than along stated party beliefs.

As I've previously mentioned we are not promoting a specific solution but calling for a Convention so that all states can send delegates to propose a solution that works for the nation as a whole. We didn't talk about how we are recommending that delegates be chosen. The resolution calls for delegates from each congressional district made up of equally of individuals currently elected to state and local office, or be selected by election. Though all individuals elected or appointed to federal office, now or in the past, would be prohibited from serving as delegates to the convention. As the delegates are sent by each state, if they go against the states wishes they can be recalled and replaced.

Additionally I want to make sure I've completely addressed your concerns about a runaway convention. In order to do so I've attached a pdf of a handout created by American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) about the Article V process. In particular I'd like to draw your attention to page 17-18 in the printed handout(19-20 when viewed on computer PDF reader) covering the Myth of a Runaway Convention. It explains in a concise but detail way why a Runaway Convention is not possible.

Article V is a core component of the Constitution. The Founders put it in place to be used by the States and We the People to reign in an out-of-control Congress. I truly believe that a Senator who is concerned about making sure that he hears the voices of his constitutions by holding listening sessions is the kind of leader we need to help us trail blaze on an issue that is so important to so many people on the right and the left.

I look forward to continuing to talk with you on this resolution and hope to sit down again with Ms. Prange and with you Senator Marklein.


Sincerely,

Telzey Felber, DVM",N/A,WI

Fred Risser,Jason Gullett,1/27/2017,Phone call with Legislator,"I had a phone call with Senator Risser this morning, which was somewhat of a follow up to a conversation we had last year. At that time, his stance was that he was not for a constitutional convention, though he strongly opposed money in politics. For this meeting, he had done some research/review of last years proposal, and his biggest concerns were last years wording of the resolve clause of the legislation and a runaway convention. I updated him with the current wording of the resolve clause, and he agreed it was an improvement, though he still wants to see the ""free and fair elections"" line say ""take money out of politics,"" or some like phrase. Nevertheless, he was impressed with the improvements of the language, especially from its form two years ago (I have no idea what any draft we had looked like 2 years ago, but hurray!). His other big issue was runaway convention, which we spent the majority of our conversation discussing. Essentially, he doesn't trust the Republicans to actually try to get something done at a convention like this. However, after hashing through the fact that the worst case is that this is a giant waste of time to keep the status quo, and him agreeing that the supreme court and congress are unlikely to make a change for some time... HE'S ON BOARD! Well, he specifically said he won't be a champion for the bill, meaning that in he won't sponsor it (and likely won't co-sponsor it, though I think he may be persuaded to ink his name if that's all that was required) but he said if it comes up for a vote, whether introduced by a republican or democrat (with the language of the bill as it currently exists, mind you), he will vote for it. So all in all I'd say that's good news, considering last I'd spoken to him he thought he'd probably vote against the bill.",1 - Supportive,WI

David Craig,Ryan Goodrich,4/28/2017,Phone call with staff,"Had a good conversation with Adam Gibbs. He told me a few things of note:

1. That Republicans supporting the Balanced Budget Resolution fear that the public, as well as other legislators that they're trying to get to support the balanced budget resolution, will not understand that multiple Article V calls are indeed separate. So there is going to be resistance from the ""GOP53"" towards our resolution because they do not want to confound their issue with ours.

2. That if the Balanced Budget convention happens and establishes the Article V pathway as viable (i.e. puts the fears to rest) that Sen. Craig is open to using the pathway for others issues.

3. I had a talk with him about the possibility of some form of the Udall Amendment coming out of our convention (which would allow WI to set the rules on local elections), as well as stronger disclose laws. Sen. Craig thinks that WI's rules are in the upper echelon of the states and that while the disclose laws could use improvement, WI is more open than other states thanks to the Democracy Campaign and other groups.

4. That they are not aware of any opposition from Common Cause on the Balanced Budget resolution.",N/A,WI

Carpenter in on:

Hello Senator Carpenter and Mr. Williams,

Ritch, it was nice speaking with you today. As we discussed, the purpose of SJR 24, the Free & Fair Elections Resolution, is to restore balance and integrity to our elections with a U.S. Constitutional Amendment so that the voices of average citizens aren’t drowned out by special interests (from both the left and right) and our elections work better for all Americans.

Below are links to the Free and Fair Elections resolution and flyer. Please let me know if I can count on your support, or if we can set up a time to discuss this important issue.

Click here for Free & Fair Elections Resolution

Click here for Free & Fair Elections Resolution flyer

Also Mitch, in regards to the concern that an Article V Convention would open up a pandora's box of problems, since it would allow all present to write up any old change to the constituion they wanted, and vote on those items instead, here are two articles for you to take a look at:


1) A Boston Globe article that supports your view of what would happen in an Article V Convention, were it to happen: https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2017/10/06/time-rewrite-constitution/Pcad5XvcYwBatcCz2UUKNP/story.html


2) An article written by the lawyer employed by Wolf PAC, the group I volunteer with, as a rebuttal to the Boston Globe article: https://medium.com/wolf-pac/the-fraud-behind-article-v-opposition-5c9ccd49049c


I have read the first, and have started wading into the references used in the second as rebuttals. I admit that for me, anyway, the James Madison treatise referenced is a bit too obtuse for me to glean the specific argument the author was referencing. I think I'll have better luck with the Thomas Neale material. Admittedly, the Wolf PAC rebuttal article could have been better, spelling out the specifics of how the Madison and Neale writings rebut common fears about article V conventions, and then providing the reference links for more background. But I'm willing to dive in and see what I find.


I hope both of you are as well, and I'll be interested in your views on it.


Thank you,

Laura Vanderbilt

My name is Jonas Wagner and I'm an Engineering Student at the University of Wisconsin-Platteville. I'm also a volunteer with Wolf-PAC Wisconsin to promote free and fair elections. This upcoming session we are looking to present a resolution calling for a Constitutional Amendment for free and fair elections.
The 2016 election has shown an obvious displeasure with the corrupt, money-driven establishment in DC. President-elect Trump won the presidential race because he called out the corruption. We have a plan to fix it, and Trump's overwhelming win in the 49th district shows that your constituents are in favor of 'draining the swamp' at the federal level.

Edward Brooks,Telzey Felber,1/10/2017,Met Legislator,"met with Representative Ed Brooks for Assembly District 50 in his office at the State Capital. We talked for about 15 minutes. He seems very unsure about the Resolution. He was concerned about a Runaway Convention so I went over all the points about how this was a Article V Amendment convention and that they can't become runaway. Also discussed the mandate in the resolution that also limits the Convention to this topic. He also was concerned about if this would affect funding he receives from groups like Farmers Co-ops(might have that wrong-but was some form of ag group) and Pro-Life Groups. I discussed with him about the Senator who supports this Resolution who wants to be able to get money from companies in his district but not from outside. I also pointed out that we weren't proposing a solution but just trying to get the Convention to take all these ideas and see what can be done. At this point in time I would say he is unsupportive of the Resolution or very unsure of the Resolution.

Edward Brooks,Telzey,1/19/2017,Emailed legislator,"Below is the e-mail I sent Representative Brooks. I also attached the ALEC handout on Article V conventions.

Representative Brooks,

It was wonderful to meet with you last week to discuss the Free and Fair Elections Resolution. As we discussed the purpose of the resolution is to call for an Article V Convention to propose a constitutional amendment in order to restore balance and 

integrity to our elections that will permanently protect free and fair elections in America by addressing issues raised by the decisions of the United States Supreme Court in Citizens United and related cases and events.

I, along with 87% of American Citizens, are very concerned about how money in politics is corrupting the response to issues on both the left and the right. For example when special interests lobbying Congress force unfunded mandates on State governments, requiring them to spend money without providing sufficient resources to adhere to those mandates. Or look at the results of the recent vote on allowing importation of medications from Canada. The Amendment vote didn't break and fail along party lines, it was found pretty quickly that our Senator's actually voted along the lines of who funded their campaigns and SuperPac's rather than along stated party beliefs.

As I've previously mentioned we are not promoting a specific solution but calling for a Convention so that all states can send delegates to propose a solution that works for the nation as a whole. We are calling for delegates from each congressional district made up of equally of individuals currently elected to state and local office, or be selected by election. Though all individuals elected or appointed to federal office, now or in the past, would be prohibited from serving as delegates to the convention. As the delegates are sent by each state, if they go against the states wishes they can be recalled and replaced.

Additionally I want to make sure I've completely addressed your concerns about a runaway convention. In order to do so I've attached a pdf of a handout created by American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) about the Article V process. In particular I'd like to draw your attention to page 17-18 in the printed handout(19-20 when viewed on computer PDF reader) covering the Myth of a Runaway Convention. It explains in a concise but detail way why a Runaway Convention is not possible.

Article V is a core component of the Constitution. The Founders put it in place to be used by the States and We the People to reign in an out-of-control Congress. I truly believe that a Representative who is concerned about Diary Farmers and Rural Health initiatives is the kind of leader we need to help us trail blaze on an issue that is so important to so many people on the right and the left.

I look forward to continuing to talk with you on this resolution.

Sincerely,

Telzey Felber, DVM",N/A,WI

Adam Neylon,Jason Gullett,2/2/2017,Phone call with Legislator,"I just finished a phone meeting with Representative Neylon. He is generally sympathetic to the problems caused by money in politics, but is hesitant about an Article V convention. Regarding money in politics, he raised his money for his first bid through local connections with individuals and small businesses, and is worried that a self-funded candidate would be unaffected by campaign finance reform while candidates such as himself would be harmed. However, he supports smaller changes such as transparency of donations, and seems to have mixed feelings about how to limit superpac money. Overall, his hesitancy about Article 5 conventions seems to be more about a general unfamiliarity with the process than anything. He seemed somewhat more comfortable with the idea after our conversation, but essentially is not ready to spearhead/introduce/cosponsor our legislation. However, he seemed genuinely interested in being kept up to date on the legislations progress, and I suspect if our bill got some GOP support he would likely jump on board.",2 - Not Confirmed,WI

Andre Jacque,Tom Kleewein,9/19/2017,Emailed staff,"Dear Rebecca Sande,

My name is Tom Kleewein. I met you last month when I came to your office with a Wolf-PAC colleague to talk about AJR 35. AJR 35 calls for a limited Constitutional Convention for free and fair elections in the United States. It is our contention that big money is corrupting the process at the national level. Thank you for taking the time to speak with us.

Based on his aye vote for AJR 21, which calls for a limited Constitutional Convention relating to a Balanced Budget Amendment, it is clear that Rep Jacque is supportive of the Article V process. Wolf-PAC shares the view of that Article V refers to a limited Convention.

I am writing to see if you have discussed AJR 35 or Article V with Rep Jacque. I am curious as to the Representative's view on the need for campaign financing reform, and his opinion on how big of an influence dark money is having on national politics and elections.

Thank you once again for your attention. Please contact me with any questions.


Sincerely,

Tom Kleewein

Joel Kitchens,Tom Kleewein,9/19/2017,Emailed staff,"Dear Stamena Ivanov,

My name is Tom Kleewein. I met you last month when I came to your office with two of my Wolf-PAC colleagues to talk about AJR 35. AJR 35 calls for a limited Constitutional Convention to get big money out of election politics.

It is clear that Rep Kitchens is opposed to the Article V process. Wolf-PAC does not share those concerns, but they are understandable.

I am writing to see if you have discussed AJR 35 or Article V with Rep Kitchens. More specifically, I am curious as to whether the Representative is supportive of significant campaign financing reform, when separated from the means of that reform (Article V).

Below is a link to a report titled ""Limited Constitutional Conventions under Article V of the United States Constitution"", prepared by the Office of Legal Policy at the U.S. Department of Justice in 1987. I encourage you to read the cover page written by AG Ed Meese, and the Executive Summary. It may provide some insight into the other side of the Article V argument.

Thank you once again for your attention. Please contact me with any questions.


Sincerely,

Tom Kleewein
